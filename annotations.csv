29,Expected_Monetary_Value_Analysis,A common use of  this type of analysis is a decision tree analysis (Figure 11-16)
30,Influence_Diagrams,as shown in Figure 11-7.

33,Probability_Of_Achieving_Cost_And_Time_Objectives,"For instance, in Figure 11-17, the likelihood of achieving the cost estimate of US$41 million is about 12%"
34,Risk,"risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives such as scope, schedule, cost, and quality."
35,Risk_Breakdown_Structure,An example is shown in Figure 11-4.
36,Plan_Risk_Management,"plan risk management is the process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project. the 
key benefit of this process is it ensures that the degree, type, and visibility of risk management are commensurate 
with both the risks and the importance of the project to the organization. the risk management plan is vital to 
communicate with and obtain agreement and support from all stakeholders to ensure the risk management process 
is supported and performed effectively over the project life cycle. the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of 
this process are depicted in figure 11-2. figure 11-3 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.
careful and explicit planning enhances the probability of success for other risk management processes. planning 
is also important to provide sufficient resources and time for risk management activities and to establish an agreed-
upon basis for evaluating risks. the plan risk management process should begin when a project is conceived and 
should be completed early during project planning."
37,Identify_Risks,"identify risks is the process of determining which risks may affect the project and documenting their 
characteristics. the key benefit of this process is the documentation of existing risks and the knowledge and ability 
it provides to the project team to anticipate events. the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process 
are depicted in figure 11-5. figure 11-6 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.
participants in risk identification activities may include the following: project manager, project team members, 
risk management team (if assigned), customers, subject matter experts from outside the project team, end 
users, other project managers, stakeholders, and risk management experts. while these personnel are often key 
participants for risk identification, all project personnel should be encouraged to identify potential risks.
identify risks is an iterative process, because new risks may evolve or is known as the project progresses 
through its life cycle. the frequency of iteration and participation in each cycle will vary by situation. the format of 
the risk statements should be consistent to ensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order 
to support effective analysis and response development. the risk statement should support the ability to compare 
the relative effect of one risk against others on the project. the process should involve the project team so they can 
develop and maintain a sense of ownership and responsibility for the risks and associated risk response actions. 
stakeholders outside the project team may provide additional objective information."
38,Perform_Qualitative_Risk_Analysis,"perform qualitative risk analysis is the process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action by assessing 
and combining their probability of occurrence and impact. the key benefit of this process is that it enables project 
managers to reduce the level of uncertainty and to focus on high-priority risks. the inputs, tools and techniques, 
and outputs of this process are depicted in figure 11-8. figure 11-9 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.
perform qualitative risk analysis assesses the priority of identified risks using their relative probability or 
likelihood of occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur, as well as other 
factors such as the time frame for response and the organization risk tolerance associated with the project 
constraints of cost, schedule, scope, and quality. such assessments reflect the risk attitude of the project 
team and other stakeholders. effective assessment therefore requires explicit identification and management 
of the risk approaches of key participants in the perform qualitative risk analysis process. where these risk 
approaches introduce bias into the assessment of identified risks, attention should be paid to identifying bias 
and correcting for it.
establishing definitions of the levels of probability and impact can reduce the influence of bias. the time 
criticality of risk-related actions may magnify the importance of a risk. an evaluation of the quality of the 
available information on project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of the risk importance to the project.
perform qualitative risk analysis is usually a rapid and cost-effective means of establishing priorities for plan 
risk responses and lays the foundation for perform quantitative risk analysis, if required. the perform qualitative 
risk analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle, as defined in the project risk 
management plan. this process can lead into perform quantitative risk analysis (section 11.4) or directly into plan 

risk responses (section 11.5)."
39,Perform_Quantitative_Risk_Analysis,"perform quantitative risk analysis is the process of numerically analyzing the effect of identified risks on overall 
project objectives. the key benefit of this process is that it produces quantitative risk information to support decision 
making in order to reduce project uncertainty. the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are 
depicted in figure 11-11. figure 11-12 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.
perform quantitative risk analysis is performed on risks that have been prioritized by the perform qualitative 
risk analysis process as potentially and substantially impacting the project competing demands. the perform 
quantitative risk analysis process analyzes the effect of those risks on project objectives. it is used mostly to 
evaluate the aggregate effect of all risks affecting the project. when the risks drive the quantitative analysis, the 
process may be used to assign a numerical priority rating to those risks individually.
perform quantitative risk analysis generally follows the perform qualitative risk analysis process. in some 
cases, it may not be possible to execute the perform quantitative risk analysis process due to lack of sufficient 
data to develop appropriate models. the project manager should exercise expert judgment to determine the need 
for and the viability of quantitative risk analysis. the availability of time and budget, and the need for qualitative or 
quantitative statements about risk and impacts, will determine which method(s) to use on any particular project. 
perform quantitative risk analysis should be repeated, as needed, as part of the control risks process to determine 
if the overall project risk has been satisfactorily decreased. trends may indicate the need for more or less focus on 
appropriate risk management activities."
40,Plan_Risk_Responses,"plan risk responses is the process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and to reduce 
threats to project objectives. the key benefit of this process is that it addresses the risks by their priority, inserting 
resources and activities into the budget, schedule and project management plan as needed. the inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in figure 11-18. figure 11-19 depicts the data flow diagram 
of the process.
the plan risk responses process follows the perform quantitative risk analysis process (if used). each risk 
response requires an understanding of the mechanism by which it will address the risk. this is the mechanism 
used to analyze if the risk response plan is having the desired effect. it includes the identification and assignment 
of one person (an owner for risk response) to take responsibility for each agreed-to and funded risk response. risk 
responses should be appropriate for the significance of the risk, cost-effective in meeting the challenge, realistic 
within the project context, agreed upon by all parties involved, and owned by a responsible person. selecting the 
optimum risk response from several options is often required.
the plan risk responses process presents commonly used approaches to planning responses to the risks. 
risks include threats and opportunities that can affect project success, and responses are discussed for each."
41,Control_Risks,"control risks is the process of implementing risk response plans, tracking identified risks, monitoring residual 
risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project. the key benefit of 
this process is that it improves efficiency of the risk approach throughout the project life cycle to continuously 
optimize risk responses. the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in figure 11-20. 
figure 11-21 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.
planned risk responses that are included in the risk register are executed during the life cycle of the project, but 
the project work should be continuously monitored for new, changing, and outdated risks.
the control risks process applies techniques such as variance and trend analysis, which require the use of 
performance information generated during project execution. other purposes of the control risks process are to 
determine if:
•	 project assumptions are still valid,
•	 analysis shows an assessed risk has changed or can be retired,
•	 risk management policies and procedures are being followed, and
•	 contingency reserves for cost or schedule should be modified in alignment with the current risk 
assessment.
control risks can involve choosing alternative strategies, executing a contingency or fallback plan, taking 
corrective action, and modifying the project management plan. the risk response owner reports periodically to the 
project manager on the effectiveness of the plan, any unanticipated effects, and any correction needed to handle 
the risk appropriately. control risks also includes updating the organizational process assets include project 
lessons learned databases and risk management templates, for the benefit of future projects."
