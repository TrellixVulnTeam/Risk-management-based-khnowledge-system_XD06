analysis, response planning, and controlling risk on a project. the objectives of project risk management are to 
increase the likelihood and impact of positive events, and decrease the likelihood and impact of negative events 
in the project.
figure 11-1 provides an overview of the project risk management processes, which are as follows:
11.1  plan risk management—the process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a 
project.
11.2  identify risks—the process of determining which risks may affect the project and documenting 

their characteristics.
11.3  perform qualitative risk analysis—the process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action 
by assessing and combining their probability of occurrence and impact.
11.4  perform quantitative risk analysis—the process of numerically analyzing the effect of identified

to reduce threats to project objectives.
11.6  control risks—the process of implementing risk response plans, tracking identified risks, monitoring 
residual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project.
these processes interact with each other and with processes in other knowledge areas as described in detail

project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or 
more project objectives such as scope, schedule, cost, and quality. a risk may have one or more causes and, 
if it occurs, it may have one or more impacts. a cause may be a given or potential requirement, assumption, 
constraint, or condition that creates the possibility of negative or positive outcomes. for example, causes could 
include the requirement of an environmental permit to do work, or having limited personnel assigned to design the 
project. the risk is that the permitting agency may take longer than planned to issue a permit; or, in the case of 
an opportunity, additional development personnel may become available who can participate in design, and they 
can be assigned to the project. if either of these uncertain events occurs, there may be an impact on the project, 
scope, cost, schedule, quality, or performance. risk conditions may include aspects of the project or organization 
environment that contribute to project risksuch as immature project management practices, lack of integrated 
management systems, concurrent multiple projects, or dependency on external participants who are outside the 
project direct control.
project risk has its origins in the uncertainty present in all projects. known risks are those that have been 
identified and analyzed, making it possible to plan responses for those risks. known risks that cannot be managed 
proactively, should be assigned a contingency reserve. unknown risks cannot be managed proactively and therefore 
may be assigned a management reserve. a negative project risk that has occurred is considered an issue.
individual project risks are different from overall project risk. overall project risk represents the effect of 
uncertainty on the project as a whole. it is more than the sum of the individual risks within a project, since it includes 
all sources of project uncertainty. it represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in 
project outcome, both positive and negative.
organizations perceive risk as the effect of uncertainty on projects and organizational objectives. organizations 
and stakeholders are willing to accept varying degrees of risk depending on their risk attitude. the risk attitudes of 
both the organization and the stakeholders may be influenced by a number of factors, which are broadly classified 
into three themes:
•	 risk appetite, which is the degree of uncertainty an entity is willing to take on in anticipation of a reward.
•	  risk tolerance, which is the degree, amount, or volume of risk that an organization or individual will 
withstand.
•	  risk threshold, which refers to measures along the level of uncertainty or the level of impact at which a 
stakeholder may have a specific interest below that risk threshold, the organization will accept the risk. 
above that risk threshold, the organization will not tolerate the risk.
for example, an organization risk attitude may include its appetite for uncertainty, its threshold for risk levels 
that are unacceptable, or its risk tolerance at which point the organization may select a different risk response.
positive and negative risks are commonly referred to as opportunities and threats. the project may be accepted 
if the risks are within tolerances and are in balance with the rewards that may be gained by taking the risks. positive 
risks that offer opportunities within the limits of risk tolerances may be pursued in order to generate enhanced 
value. for example, adopting an aggressive resource optimization technique is a risk taken in anticipation of a 
reward for using fewer resources.
individuals and groups adopt attitudes toward risk that influence the way they respond. these risk attitudes are 

driven by perception, tolerances, and other biases, which should be made explicit wherever possible. a consistent 
approach to risk should be developed for each project, and communication about risk and its handling should 
be open and honest. risk responses reflect an organization perceived balance between risk taking and risk 
avoidance.
to be successful, an organization should be committed to address risk management proactively and consistently 
throughout the project. a conscious choice should be made at all levels of the organization to actively identify and 
pursue effective risk management during the life of the project. project risk could exist at the moment a project 
is initiated. moving forward on a project without a proactive focus on risk management is likely to lead to more 
problems arising from unmanaged threats.
1.1 plan risk management
plan risk management is the process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project. the 
key benefit of this process is it ensures that the degree, type, and visibility of risk management are commensurate 
with both the risks and the importance of the project to the organization. the risk management plan is vital to 
communicate with and obtain agreement and support from all stakeholders to ensure the risk management process

project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or 
more project objectives such as scope, schedule, cost, and quality. a risk may have one or more causes and, 
if it occurs, it may have one or more impacts. a cause may be a given or potential requirement, assumption, 
constraint, or condition that creates the possibility of negative or positive outcomes. for example, causes could 
include the requirement of an environmental permit to do work, or having limited personnel assigned to design the 
project. the risk is that the permitting agency may take longer than planned to issue a permit; or, in the case of 
an opportunity, additional development personnel may become available who can participate in design, and they 
can be assigned to the project. if either of these uncertain events occurs, there may be an impact on the project, 
scope, cost, schedule, quality, or performance. risk conditions may include aspects of the project or organization 
environment that contribute to project risksuch as immature project management practices, lack of integrated 
management systems, concurrent multiple projects, or dependency on external participants who are outside the 
project direct control.
project risk has its origins in the uncertainty present in all projects. known risks are those that have been 
identified and analyzed, making it possible to plan responses for those risks. known risks that cannot be managed 
proactively, should be assigned a contingency reserve. unknown risks cannot be managed proactively and therefore 
may be assigned a management reserve. a negative project risk that has occurred is considered an issue.
individual project risks are different from overall project risk. overall project risk represents the effect of 
uncertainty on the project as a whole. it is more than the sum of the individual risks within a project, since it includes 
all sources of project uncertainty. it represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in 
project outcome, both positive and negative.
organizations perceive risk as the effect of uncertainty on projects and organizational objectives. organizations 
and stakeholders are willing to accept varying degrees of risk depending on their risk attitude. the risk attitudes of 
both the organization and the stakeholders may be influenced by a number of factors, which are broadly classified 
into three themes:
•	 risk appetite, which is the degree of uncertainty an entity is willing to take on in anticipation of a reward.
•	  risk tolerance, which is the degree, amount, or volume of risk that an organization or individual will 
withstand.
•	  risk threshold, which refers to measures along the level of uncertainty or the level of impact at which a 
stakeholder may have a specific interest below that risk threshold, the organization will accept the risk. 
above that risk threshold, the organization will not tolerate the risk.
for example, an organization risk attitude may include its appetite for uncertainty, its threshold for risk levels 
that are unacceptable, or its risk tolerance at which point the organization may select a different risk response.
positive and negative risks are commonly referred to as opportunities and threats. the project may be accepted 
if the risks are within tolerances and are in balance with the rewards that may be gained by taking the risks. positive 
risks that offer opportunities within the limits of risk tolerances may be pursued in order to generate enhanced 
value. for example, adopting an aggressive resource optimization technique is a risk taken in anticipation of a 
reward for using fewer resources.
individuals and groups adopt attitudes toward risk that influence the way they respond. these risk attitudes are 

driven by perception, tolerances, and other biases, which should be made explicit wherever possible. a consistent 
approach to risk should be developed for each project, and communication about risk and its handling should 
be open and honest. risk responses reflect an organization perceived balance between risk taking and risk 
avoidance.
to be successful, an organization should be committed to address risk management proactively and consistently 
throughout the project. a conscious choice should be made at all levels of the organization to actively identify and 
pursue effective risk management during the life of the project. project risk could exist at the moment a project 
is initiated. moving forward on a project without a proactive focus on risk management is likely to lead to more 
problems arising from unmanaged threats.
1.1 plan risk management
plan risk management is the process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project. the 
key benefit of this process is it ensures that the degree, type, and visibility of risk management are commensurate 
with both the risks and the importance of the project to the organization. the risk management plan is vital to 
communicate with and obtain agreement and support from all stakeholders to ensure the risk management process 
is supported and performed effectively over the project life cycle. the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of 
this process are depicted in figure 11-2. figure 11-3 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.
careful and explicit planning enhances the probability of success for other risk management processes. planning 
is also important to provide sufficient resources and time for risk management activities and to establish an agreed-
upon basis for evaluating risks. the plan risk management process should begin when a project is conceived and 
should be completed early during project planning.",Analytical_Techniques,"Analytical_Techniques are used to understand and define the overall Risk_Management_Context of the project. Risk_Management_Context is a combination of Stakeholder_Risk_Attitudes and the strategic Risk_Exposure of a given project based on the overall Project_Context. for example, a Stakeholder_Risk_Profile_Analysis may be performed to grade and qualify the Project_Stakeholder_Risk_Appetite and tolerance. other techniquessuch as the use of strategic Risk_Scoring_Sheets, are used to provide a Highlevel_Assessment of the Risk_Exposure of the project based on the overall Project_Context. depending on these assessments, the Project_Team can allocate appropriate resources and focus on the Risk_Management_Activities .",{}

managers to reduce the level of uncertainty and to focus on high-priority risks. the inputs, tools and techniques, 
and outputs of this process are depicted in figure 11-8. figure 11-9 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.
perform qualitative risk analysis assesses the priority of identified risks using their relative probability or 
likelihood of occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur, as well as other 
factors such as the time frame for response and the organization risk tolerance associated with the project 
constraints of cost, schedule, scope, and quality. such assessments reflect the risk attitude of the project 
team and other stakeholders. effective assessment therefore requires explicit identification and management 
of the risk approaches of key participants in the perform qualitative risk analysis process. where these risk 
approaches introduce bias into the assessment of identified risks, attention should be paid to identifying bias 
and correcting for it.
establishing definitions of the levels of probability and impact can reduce the influence of bias. the time 
criticality of risk-related actions may magnify the importance of a risk. an evaluation of the quality of the 
available information on project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of the risk importance to the project.

risk responses and lays the foundation for perform quantitative risk analysis, if required. the perform qualitative

Risk_Rating_Rules can be tailored in the Plan_Risk_Management_Process to the specific project. as illustrated in figure 11 - 10, an organization can rate a risk separately for each objective( such as cost, time, and scope) . in addition, it may develop ways to determine one overall rating for each risk. finally, opportunities and threats are handled in the same matrix using definitions of the different levels of impact that are appropriate for each. the Risk_Score helps guide Risk_Responses. for example, risks that have a negative impact on objectives, otherwise known as threats if they occur, and that are in the highrisk( dark gray) zone of the matrix, may require Priority_Action and aggressive Response_Strategies. threats found in the lowrisk( medium gray) zone may not require proactive Management_Action beyond being placed in the Risk_Register as part of the Watch_List or adding a Contingency_Reserve. similarly for opportunities, those in the highrisk( dark gray) zone, which may be obtained most easily and offer the greatest benefit, should be targeted first. opportunities in the lowrisk( medium gray) zone should be monitored.",{}

risks include threats and opportunities that can affect project success, and responses are discussed for each.",Strategies_For_Negative_Risks_Or_Threats,"three strategies, which typically deal with threats or risks that may have negative impacts on Project_Objectives if they occur, are: avoid, transfer, and mitigate. the fourth strategy, accept, can be used for negative risks or threats as well as positive risks or opportunities. each of these Risk_Response_Strategies have varied and unique influence on the Risk_Condition. these strategies should be chosen to match the Risk_Probability and impact on the project overall objectives. avoidance and Mitigation_Strategies are usually good strategies for critical risks with high impact, while transference and acceptance are usually good strategies for threats that are less critical and with low overall impact. the four strategies for dealing with negative risks or threats are further described as follows: • avoid Risk_Avoidance is a Risk_Response_Strategy whereby the Project_Team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its impact. it usually involves changing the Project_Management_Plan to eliminate the threat entirely. the Project_Manager may also isolate the Project_Objectives from the Risk_Impact or change the objective that is in jeopardy. examples of this include extending the schedule, changing the strategy, or reducing scope. the most radical Avoidance_Strategy is to shut down the project entirely. some risks that arise early in the project can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, improving communication, or acquiring expertise. •_Transfer_Risk_Transference is a Risk_Response_Strategy whereby the Project_Team shifts the impact of a threat to a third party, together with ownership of the response. transferring the risk simply gives another Party_Responsibility for its management— it does not eliminate it. transferring does not mean disowning the risk by transferring it to a later project or another person without his or her knowledge or agreement. Risk_Transference nearly always involves payment of a Risk_Premium to the party taking on the risk. transferring liability for risk is most effective in dealing with financial Risk_Exposure. Transference_Tools can be quite diverse and include the use of insurance, Performance_Bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. contracts or agreements may be used to transfer liability for specified risks to another party. for example, when a buyer has capabilities that the seller does not possess, it may be prudent to transfer some work and its concurrent risk contractually back to the buyer. in many cases, use of a costplus contract may transfer the Cost_Risk to the buyer, while a Fixedprice_Contract may transfer risk to the seller. • mitigate Risk_Mitigation is a Risk_Response_Strategy whereby the Project_Team acts to reduce the probability of occurrence or impact of a risk. it implies a reduction in the probability and/or impact of an adverse risk to be within acceptable Threshold_Limits. taking early action to reduce the probability and/or impact of a risk occurring on the project is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the risk has occurred. adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable supplier are examples of Mitigation_Actions. mitigation may require Prototype_Development to reduce the risk of scaling up from a Benchscale_Model of a process or product. where it is not possible to reduce probability, a Mitigation_Response might address the Risk_Impact by targeting linkages that determine the severity. for example, Designing_Redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component. • accept Risk_Acceptance is a Risk_Response_Strategy whereby the Project_Team decides to acknowledge the risk and not take any action unless the risk occurs. this strategy is adopted where it is not possible or costeffective to address a specific risk in any other way. this strategy indicates that the Project_Team has decided not to change the Project_Management_Plan to deal with a risk, or is unable to identify any other suitable Response_Strategy. this strategy can be either passive or active. passive acceptance requires no action except to document the strategy, leaving the Project_Team to deal with the risks as they occur, and to periodically review the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly. the most common active Acceptance_Strategy is to establish a Contingency_Reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the risks .",{}
