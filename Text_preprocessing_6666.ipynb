In some \\ncases, it may not be possible to execute the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process due to lack of sufficient \\ndata to develop appropriate models. The project manager should exercise expert judgment to determine the need \\nfor and the viability of quantitative risk analysis. The availability of time and budget, and the need for qualitative or \\nquantitative statements about risk and impacts, will determine which method(s) to use on any particular project. \\nPerform Quantitative Risk Analysis should be repeated, as needed, as part of the Control Risks process to determine \\nif the overall project risk has been satisfactorily decreased. Trends may indicate the need for more or less focus on \\nappropriate risk management activities.\\n11.4.1 Perform Quantitative risk Analysis: Inputs\\n11.4.1.1 risk Management Plan\\nDescribed in Section 11.1.3.1. The risk management plan provides guidelines, methods, and tools to be used in \\nquantitative risk analysis.\\n11\\n11.4.1.2 cost Management Plan\\nDescribed in Section 7.1.3.1.

The organizational process assets that can influence the Perform Quantitative Risk \\nAnalysis process include information from prior, similar completed projects.\\n11.4.2 Perform Quantitative risk Analysis: tools and techniques\\n11.4.2.1 data Gathering and representation techniques\\n•\\t  Interviewing. Interviewing techniques draw on experience and historical data to quantify the probability \\nand impact of risks on project objectives. The information needed depends upon the type of probability \\ndistributions that will be used. For instance, information would be gathered on the optimistic (low), \\npessimistic (high), and most likely scenarios for some commonly used distributions. Examples of three-\\npoint estimates for cost are shown in Figure 11-13. Additional information on three-point estimates \\nappears in Estimate Activity Durations (Section 6.5) and Estimate Costs (Section 7.2). Documenting the \\nrationale of the risk ranges and the assumptions behind them are important components of the risk \\ninterview because they can provide insight on the reliability and credibility of the analysis.\\n11 - PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT\\n•\\t  Probability distributions. Continuous probability distributions, which are used extensively in modeling \\nand simulation, represent the uncertainty in values such as durations of schedule activities and costs \\nof project components. Discrete distributions can be used to represent uncertain events, such as the \\noutcome of a test or a possible scenario in a decision tree. Two examples of widely used continuous \\ndistributions are shown in Figure 11-14. These distributions depict shapes that are compatible with the \\ndata typically developed during the quantitative risk analysis. Uniform distributions can be used if there \\nis no obvious value that is more likely than any other between specified high and low bounds, such as in \\nthe early concept stage of design.\\n11 - PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT\\n11.4.2.2 Quantitative risk Analysis and Modeling techniques\\nCommonly used techniques use both event-oriented and project-oriented analysis approaches, including:\\n•\\t  Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which risks have the most potential \\nimpact on the project. It helps to understand how the variations in project’s objectives correlate with \\nvariations in different uncertainties. Conversely, it examines the extent to which the uncertainty of \\neach project element affects the objective being studied when all other uncertain elements are held at \\ntheir baseline values. One typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram (Figure 11-15), \\nwhich is useful for comparing relative importance and impact of variables that have a high degree of \\nuncertainty to those that are more stable. The Tornado diagram is also helpful in analyzing risk-taking \\nscenarios enabled on specific risks whose quantitative analysis highlights possible benefits greater \\nthan corresponding identified negative impacts. A tornado diagram is a special type of bar chart used \\nin sensitivity analysis for comparing the relative importance of the variables. In a tornado diagram, \\nthe Y-axis contains each type of uncertainty at base values, and the X-axis contains the spread or \\ncorrelation of the uncertainty to the studied output. In this figure, each uncertainty contains a horizontal \\nbar and is ordered vertically to show uncertainties with a decreasing spread from the base values.\\n11 - PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT\\n•\\t  Expected monetary value analysis. Expected monetary value (EMV) analysis is a statistical concept \\nthat calculates the average outcome when the future includes scenarios that may or may not happen \\n(i.e., analysis under uncertainty). The EMV of opportunities are generally expressed as positive values, \\nwhile those of threats are expressed as negative values. EMV requires a risk-neutral assumption—\\nneither risk averse nor risk seeking. EMV for a project is calculated by multiplying the value of each \\npossible outcome by its probability of occurrence and adding the products together. A common use of \\nthis type of analysis is a decision tree analysis (Figure 11-16).\\n11 - PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT\\n•\\t  Modeling and simulation. A project simulation uses a model that translates the specified detailed \\nuncertainties of the project into their potential impact on project objectives. Simulations are typically \\nperformed using the Monte Carlo technique. In a simulation, the project model is computed many times \\n(iterated), with the input values (e.g., cost estimates or activity durations) chosen at random for each \\niteration from the probability distributions of these variables. A histogram (e.g., total cost or completion \\ndate) is calculated from the iterations. For a cost risk analysis, a simulation uses cost estimates. For a \\nschedule risk analysis, the schedule network diagram and duration estimates are used. The output from a \\ncost risk simulation using the three-element model and risk ranges is shown in Figure 11-17. It illustrates \\nthe respective probability of achieving specific cost targets. Similar curves can be developed for other \\nproject objectives.\\n11 - PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT\\n11.4.2.3 Expert Judgment\\nExpert judgment (ideally using experts with relevant, recent experience) is required to identify potential cost \\nand schedule impacts, to evaluate probability, and to define inputs such as probability distributions into the tools.\\nExpert judgment also comes into play in the interpretation of the data. Experts should be able to identify the \\nweaknesses of the tools as well as their strengths. Experts may determine when a specific tool may or may not be \\nmore appropriate given the organization’s capabilities and culture.\\n11.4.3 Perform Quantitative risk Analysis: outputs\\n11.4.3.1 Project documents updates\\nProject documents are updated with information resulting from quantitative risk analysis. For example, risk \\nregister updates could include:\\n•\\t  Probabilistic analysis of the project. Estimates are made of potential project schedule and cost  11\\noutcomes listing the possible completion dates and costs with their associated confidence levels. \\nThis output, often expressed as a cumulative frequency distribution, is used with stakeholder risk \\ntolerances to permit quantification of the cost and time contingency reserves. Such contingency \\nreserves are needed to bring the risk of overrunning stated project objectives to a level acceptable to \\nthe organization.\\n•\\t  Probability of achieving cost and time objectives. With the risks facing the project, the probability \\nof achieving project objectives under the current plan can be estimated using quantitative risk analysis \\nresults. For instance, in Figure 11-17, the likelihood of achieving the cost estimate of US$41 million is \\nabout 12%.\\n•\\t  Prioritized list of quantified risks. This list includes those risks that pose the greatest threat or present \\nthe greatest opportunity to the project. These include the risks that may have the greatest effect on cost \\ncontingency and those that are most likely to influence the critical path. These risks may be evaluated, in \\nsome cases, through a tornado diagram generated as a result of the simulation analysis.\\n•\\t  trends in quantitative risk analysis results. As the analysis is repeated, a trend may become apparent \\nthat leads to conclusions affecting risk responses. Organizational historical information on project schedule, \\ncost, quality, and performance should reflect new insights gained through the Perform Quantitative Risk \\nAnalysis process. Such history may take the form of a quantitative risk analysis report. This report may \\nbe separate from, or linked to, the risk register.\\n©2013 Project Management Institute.

The key benefit of this process is that it addresses the risks by their priority, inserting \\nresources and activities into the budget, schedule and project management plan as needed. The inputs, tools and \\ntechniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 11-18. Figure 11-19 depicts the data flow diagram \\nof the process.\\n11 - PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT\\nThe Plan Risk Responses process follows the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process (if used). Each risk \\nresponse requires an understanding of the mechanism by which it will address the risk. This is the mechanism \\nused to analyze if the risk response plan is having the desired effect. It includes the identification and assignment \\nof one person (an owner for risk response) to take responsibility for each agreed-to and funded risk response. Risk \\nresponses should be appropriate for the significance of the risk, cost-effective in meeting the challenge, realistic \\nwithin the project context, agreed upon by all parties involved, and owned by a responsible person. Selecting the \\noptimum risk response from several options is often required.\\nThe Plan Risk Responses process presents commonly used approaches to planning responses to the risks. \\nRisks include threats and opportunities that can affect project success, and responses are discussed for each.\\n11.5.1 Plan risk responses: Inputs\\n11.5.1.1 risk Management Plan\\nImportant components of the risk management plan include roles and responsibilities, risk analysis definitions, \\n11\\ntiming for reviews (and for eliminating risks from review), and risk thresholds for low, moderate, and high risks. Risk \\nthresholds help identify those risks for which specific responses are needed.\\n11.5.1.2 risk register\\nThe risk register refers to identified risks, root causes of risks, lists of potential responses, risk owners, symptoms \\nand warning signs, the relative rating or priority list of project risks, risks requiring responses in the near term, risks \\nfor additional analysis and response, trends in qualitative analysis results, and a watch list, which is a list of low-\\npriority risks within the risk register.\\n11.5.2 Plan risk responses: tools and techniques\\nSeveral risk response strategies are available. The strategy or mix of strategies most likely to be effective \\nshould be selected for each risk. Risk analysis tools, such as decision tree analysis (Section 11.4.2.2), can be \\nused to choose the most appropriate responses. Specific actions are developed to implement that strategy, \\nincluding primary and backup strategies, as necessary. A fallback plan can be developed for implementation \\nif the selected strategy turns out not to be fully effective or if an accepted risk occurs. Secondary risks should \\nalso be reviewed. Secondary risks are risks that arise as a direct result of implementing a risk response. A \\ncontingency reserve is often allocated for time or cost. If developed, it may include identification of the conditions \\nthat trigger its use.\\n©2013 Project Management Institute. A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – Fifth Edition  343\\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412\\nThis copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.11 - PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT\\n11.5.2.1 Strategies for negative risks or threats\\nThree strategies, which typically deal with threats or risks that may have negative impacts on project objectives \\nif they occur, are: avoid, transfer, and mitigate. The fourth strategy, accept, can be used for negative risks or threats \\nas well as positive risks or opportunities. Each of these risk response strategies have varied and unique influence \\non the risk condition. These strategies should be chosen to match the risk’s probability and impact on the project’s \\noverall objectives. Avoidance and mitigation strategies are usually good strategies for critical risks with high impact, \\nwhile transference and acceptance are usually good strategies for threats that are less critical and with low overall \\nimpact. The four strategies for dealing with negative risks or threats are further described as follows:\\n•\\t  Avoid. Risk avoidance is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to eliminate the threat or \\nprotect the project from its impact. It usually involves changing the project management plan to eliminate \\nthe threat entirely. The project manager may also isolate the project objectives from the risk’s impact or \\nchange the objective that is in jeopardy. Examples of this include extending the schedule, changing the \\nstrategy, or reducing scope. The most radical avoidance strategy is to shut down the project entirely. \\nSome risks that arise early in the project can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, \\nimproving communication, or acquiring expertise.\\n•\\t  transfer. Risk transference is a risk response strategy whereby the project team shifts the impact of \\na threat to a third party, together with ownership of the response. Transferring the risk simply gives \\nanother party responsibility for its management—it does not eliminate it. Transferring does not mean \\ndisowning the risk by transferring it to a later project or another person without his or her knowledge or \\nagreement. Risk transference nearly always involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on \\nthe risk. Transferring liability for risk is most effective in dealing with financial risk exposure. Transference \\ntools can be quite diverse and include, but are not limited to, the use of insurance, performance bonds, \\nwarranties, guarantees, etc. Contracts or agreements may be used to transfer liability for specified risks \\nto another party. For example, when a buyer has capabilities that the seller does not possess, it may be \\nprudent to transfer some work and its concurrent risk contractually back to the buyer. In many cases, use \\nof a cost-plus contract may transfer the cost risk to the buyer, while a fixed-price contract may transfer \\nrisk to the seller.\\n344 ©2013 Project Management Institute. A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – Fifth Edition \\nLicensed To: Jorge Diego Fuentes Sanchez PMI MemberID: 2399412\\nThis copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.11 - PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT\\n•\\t  Mitigate. Risk mitigation is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to reduce the \\nprobability of occurrence or impact of a risk. It implies a reduction in the probability and/or impact of an \\nadverse risk to be within acceptable threshold limits. Taking early action to reduce the probability and/or \\nimpact of a risk occurring on the project is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the \\nrisk has occurred. Adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable \\nsupplier are examples of mitigation actions. Mitigation may require prototype development to reduce the \\nrisk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product. Where it is not possible to reduce \\nprobability, a mitigation response might address the risk impact by targeting linkages that determine the \\nseverity. For example, designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the \\noriginal component.\\n•\\t  Accept. Risk acceptance is a risk response strategy whereby the project team decides to acknowledge \\nthe risk and not take any action unless the risk occurs. This strategy is adopted where it is not possible \\nor cost-effective to address a specific risk in any other way. This strategy indicates that the project \\nteam has decided not to change the project management plan to deal with a risk, or is unable to identify \\nany other suitable response strategy. This strategy can be either passive or active. Passive acceptance \\nrequires no action except to document the strategy, leaving the project team to deal with the risks as \\n11\\nthey occur, and to periodically review the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly. The \\nmost common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of \\ntime, money, or resources to handle the risks.\\n11.5.2.2 Strategies for Positive risks or opportunities\\nThree of the four responses are suggested to deal with risks with potentially positive impacts on project objectives. \\nThe fourth strategy, accept, can be used for negative risks or threats as well as positive risks or opportunities. These \\nstrategies, described below, are to exploit, share, enhance, and accept.\\n•\\t  Exploit. The exploit strategy may be selected for risks with positive impacts where the organization wishes \\nto ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to eliminate the uncertainty associated with \\na particular upside risk by ensuring the opportunity definitely happens. Examples of directly exploiting \\nresponses include assigning an organization’s most talented resources to the project to reduce the time \\nto completion or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration required to \\nrealize project objectives.\\n©2013 Project Management Institute.

The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or the positive impacts of an \\nopportunity. Identifying and maximizing key drivers of these positive-impact risks may increase the \\nprobability of their occurrence. Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to \\nan activity to finish early.\\n•\\t  Share. Sharing a positive risk involves allocating some or all of the ownership of the opportunity to a \\nthird party who is best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project. Examples of sharing \\nactions include forming risk-sharing partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures, \\nwhich can be established with the express purpose of taking advantage of the opportunity so that all \\nparties gain from their actions.\\n•\\t  Accept. Accepting an opportunity is being willing to take advantage of the opportunity if it arises, but \\nnot actively pursuing it.\\n11.5.2.3 contingent response Strategies\\nSome responses are designed for use only if certain events occur. For some risks, it is appropriate for \\nthe project team to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predefined conditions, if \\nit is believed that there will be sufficient warning to implement the plan. Events that trigger the contingency \\nresponse, such as missing intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with a supplier, should be defined \\nand tracked. Risk responses identified using this technique are often called contingency plans or fallback plans \\nand include identified triggering events that set the plans in effect.\\n11.5.2.4 Expert Judgment\\nExpert judgment is input from knowledgeable parties pertaining to the actions to be taken on a specific and \\ndefined risk. Expertise may be provided by any group or person with specialized education, knowledge, skill, \\nexperience, or training in establishing risk responses.\\n11.5.3 Plan risk responses: outputs\\n11.5.3.1 Project Management Plan updates\\nElements of the project management plan that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include, \\nbut are not limited to:\\n346 ©2013 Project Management Institute.

The staffing management plan, part of the human resource \\nmanagement plan, is updated to reflect changes in project organizational structure and resource \\n11\\napplications driven by the risk responses. This may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to \\nstaff allocation, as well as updates to the resource loading.\\n•\\t  Scope baseline. Because of new, modified or omitted work generated by the risk responses, the scope \\nbaseline may be updated to reflect those changes.\\n•\\t  Schedule baseline. Because of new work (or omitted work) generated by the risk responses, the schedule \\nbaseline may be updated to reflect those changes.\\n•\\t  cost baseline. Because of new work (or omitted work) generated by the risk responses, the cost baseline \\nmay be updated to reflect those changes.\\n11.5.3.2 Project documents updates\\nIn the Plan Risk Responses process, several project documents are updated as needed. For example, when \\nappropriate risk responses are chosen and agreed upon, they are included in the risk register. The risk register \\nshould be written to a level of detail that corresponds with the priority ranking and the planned response. Often, the \\nhigh and moderate risks are addressed in detail. Risks judged to be of low priority are included in a watch list for \\nperiodic monitoring. Updates to the risk register can include, but are not limited to:\\n©2013 Project Management Institute.

The key benefit of \\nthis process is that it improves efficiency of the risk approach throughout the project life cycle to continuously \\noptimize risk responses. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 11-20. \\nFigure 11-21 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n11 - PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT\\nPlanned risk responses that are included in the risk register are executed during the life cycle of the project, but \\nthe project work should be continuously monitored for new, changing, and outdated risks.\\nThe Control Risks process applies techniques, such as variance and trend analysis, which require the use of \\nperformance information generated during project execution. Other purposes of the Control Risks process are to \\ndetermine if:\\n•\\t Project assumptions are still valid,\\n•\\t Analysis shows an assessed risk has changed or can be retired,\\n•\\t Risk management policies and procedures are being followed, and\\n•\\t  Contingency reserves for cost or schedule should be modified in alignment with the current risk \\nassessment.\\nControl Risks can involve choosing alternative strategies, executing a contingency or fallback plan, taking \\ncorrective action, and modifying the project management plan. The risk response owner reports periodically to the \\nproject manager on the effectiveness of the plan, any unanticipated effects, and any correction needed to handle \\nthe risk appropriately. Control Risks also includes updating the organizational process assets, including project \\nlessons learned databases and risk management templates, for the benefit of future projects.\\n11.6.1 control risks: Inputs\\n11.6.1.1 Project Management Plan\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. The project management plan, which includes the risk management plan, provides \\nguidance for risk monitoring and controlling.\\n11.6.1.2 risk register\\nThe risk register has key inputs that include identified risks and risk owners, agreed-upon risk responses, \\ncontrol actions for assessing the effectiveness of response plans, risk responses, specific implementation actions, \\nsymptoms and warning signs of risk, residual and secondary risks, a watch list of low-priority risks, and the time \\nand cost contingency reserves. The watch list is within the risk register and provides a list of low-priority risks.\\n350 ©2013 Project Management Institute.

Work performance data related to various performance results possibly impacted \\nby risks includes, but is not limited to:\\n•\\t Deliverable status,\\n•\\t Schedule progress, and\\n•\\t Costs incurred.\\n11.6.1.4 Work Performance reports\\nDescribed in Section 4.4.3.2. Work performance reports take information from performance measurements \\nand analyze it to provide project work performance information including variance analysis, earned value data, and \\nforecasting data. These data points could be impactful in controlling performance related risks.\\n11.6.2 control risks: tools and techniques\\n11\\n11.6.2.1 risk reassessment\\nControl Risks often results in identification of new risks, reassessment of current risks, and the closing of risks \\nthat are outdated. Project risk reassessments should be regularly scheduled. The amount and detail of repetition \\nthat are appropriate depends on how the project progresses relative to its objectives.\\n11.6.2.2 risk Audits\\nRisk audits examine and document the effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with identified risks and their \\nroot causes, as well as the effectiveness of the risk management process. The project manager is responsible for \\nensuring that risk audits are performed at an appropriate frequency, as defined in the project’s risk management \\nplan. Risk audits may be included during routine project review meetings, or the team may choose to hold separate \\nrisk audit meetings. The format for the audit and its objectives should be clearly defined before the audit is conducted.\\n©2013 Project Management Institute.

For the \\npurposes of controlling risks, trends in the project’s execution should be reviewed using performance information. \\nEarned value analysis and other methods of project variance and trend analysis may be used for monitoring overall \\nproject performance. Outcomes from these analyses may forecast potential deviation of the project at completion \\nfrom cost and schedule targets. Deviation from the baseline plan may indicate the potential impact of threats or \\nopportunities.\\n11.6.2.4 technical Performance Measurement\\nTechnical performance measurement compares technical accomplishments during project execution to the \\nschedule of technical achievement. It requires the definition of objective, quantifiable measures of technical \\nperformance, which can be used to compare actual results against targets. Such technical performance measures \\nmay include weight, transaction times, number of delivered defects, storage capacity, etc. Deviation, such as \\ndemonstrating more or less functionality than planned at a milestone, can help to forecast the degree of success \\nin achieving the project’s scope.\\n11.6.2.5 reserve Analysis\\nThroughout execution of the project, some risks may occur with positive or negative impacts on budget or \\nschedule contingency reserves. Reserve analysis compares the amount of the contingency reserves remaining to \\nthe amount of risk remaining at any time in the project in order to determine if the remaining reserve is adequate.\\n11.6.2.6 Meetings\\nProject risk management should be an agenda item at periodic status meetings. The amount of time required \\nfor that item will vary, depending upon the risks that have been identified, their priority, and difficulty of response. \\nThe more often risk management is practiced, the easier it becomes. Frequent discussions about risk make it more \\nlikely that people will identify risks and opportunities.\\n352 ©2013 Project Management Institute.

       "'1 plan risk management\\nplan risk management is the process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project. the \\nkey benefit of this process is it ensures that the degree, type, and visibility of risk management are commensurate \\nwith both the risks and the importance of the project to the organization. the risk management plan is vital to \\ncommunicate with and obtain agreement and support from all stakeholders to ensure the risk management process \\nis supported and performed effectively over the project life cycle. the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of \\nthis process are depicted in figure 11-2. figure 11-3 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\ncareful and explicit planning enhances the probability of success for other risk management processes. planning \\nis also important to provide sufficient resources and time for risk management activities and to establish an agreed-\\nupon basis for evaluating risks. the plan risk management process should begin when a project is conceived and \\nshould be completed early during project planning.\\n11.1.1 plan risk management: inputs\\n11.1.1.1 project management plan\\nin planning risk management, all approved subsidiary management plans and baselines should be taken into \\nconsideration in order to make the risk management plan consistent with them. the risk management plan is also \\na component of the project management plan. the project management plan provides baseline or current state of \\nrisk-affected areas including scope, schedule, and cost.\\n11.1.1.2 project charter\\ndescribed in section 4.1.3.1. the project charter can provide various inputs such as high-level risks, high-level \\nproject descriptions, and high-level requirements.\\n11.1.1.3 stakeholder register\\ndescribed in section 13.1.3.1. the stakeholder register, which contains all details related to the project \\nstakeholders, provides an overview of their roles.\\n11.1.1.4 enterprise environmental factors\\ndescribed in section 2.1.5. the enterprise environmental factors that can influence the plan risk management \\nprocess include risk attitudes, thresholds, and tolerances that describe the degree of risk \\nthat an organization will withstand.\\n11.1.1.5 organizational process assets\\ndescribed in section 2.1.4. the organizational process assets that can influence the plan risk management \\nprocess include:\\n•\\t risk categories,\\n•\\t common definitions of concepts and terms,\\n•\\t risk statement formats,\\n•\\t standard templates,\\n•\\t roles and responsibilities,\\n•\\t authority levels for decision making, and\\n•\\t lessons learned.\\n11.1.2 plan risk management: tools and techniques\\n11.1.2.1 analytical techniques\\nanalytical techniques are used to understand and define the overall risk management context of the project. \\nrisk management context is a combination of stakeholder risk attitudes and the strategic risk exposure of a given \\n\\nproject based on the overall project context. for example, a stakeholder risk profile analysis may be performed to \\ngrade and qualify the project stakeholder risk appetite and tolerance. other techniques such as the use of strategic \\nrisk scoring sheets, are used to provide a high-level assessment of the risk exposure of the project based on the \\noverall project context. depending on these assessments, the project team can allocate appropriate resources and \\nfocus on the risk management activities.\\n11.1.2.2 expert judgment\\nexpert_judgment considered from groups_or_individuals such as:\\n•\\t senior management,\\n•\\t project stakeholders,\\n•\\t project managers who have worked on projects in the same area (directly or through lessons learned),\\n•\\t subject matter experts (smes) in business or project area,\\n•\\t industry groups and consultants, and\\n•\\t professional and technical associations.\\n11.1.2.3 meetings\\nproject teams hold planning meetings to develop the risk management plan. attendees at these meetings may \\ninclude the project manager, selected project team members and stakeholders, anyone in the organization with \\nresponsibility to manage the risk planning and execution activities, and others, as needed.\\nhigh-level plans for conducting the risk management activities are defined in these meetings. risk management \\ncost elements and schedule activities should be developed for inclusion in the project budget and schedule, \\nrespectively. risk contingency reserve application approaches may be established or reviewed. risk management \\nresponsibilities should be assigned. general organizational templates for risk categories and definitions of terms \\nsuch as levels of risk, probability by type of risk, impact by type of objectives, and the probability and impact matrix \\nwill be tailored to the specific project. if templates for other steps in the process do not exist, they may be generated \\nin these meetings. the outputs of these activities are summarized in the risk management plan.\\n11.1.3 plan risk management: outputs\\n11.1.3.1 risk management plan\\nthe risk management plan is a component of the project management plan and describes how risk management \\nactivities will be structured and performed. the risk management plan include:\\n•\\t methodology. defines the approaches, tools, and data sources that will be used to perform risk \\nmanagement on the project.\\n•\\t roles and responsibilities. defines the lead, support, and risk management team members for each \\ntype of activity in the risk management plan, and clarifies their responsibilities.\\n•\\t budgeting. estimates funds needed, based on assigned resources, for inclusion in the cost baseline and \\nestablishes protocols for application of contingency and management reserves.\\n•\\t timing. defines when and how often the risk management processes will be performed throughout the \\nproject life cycle, establishes protocols for application of schedule contingency reserves, and establishes \\nrisk management activities for inclusion in the project schedule.\\n•\\t risk categories. provide a means for grouping potential causes of risk. several approaches can be \\nused, for example, a structure based on project objectives by category. a risk breakdown structure (rbs) \\nhelps the project team to look at many sources from which project risk may arise in a risk identification \\nexercise. different rbs structures will be appropriate for different types of projects. an organization can \\nuse a previously prepared custom categorization framework, which may take the form of a simple list of \\ncategories or may be structured into an rbs. the rbs is a hierarchical representation of risks according \\nto their risk categories. an example is shown in figure 11-4.\\nbeta distribution triangular distribution\\n0.1 0.1\\n\\n0.0 0.0\\nbeta and triangular distributions are frequently used in quantitative risk analysis. the data shown in the figure \\non the left (beta distribution) is one example of a family of such distributions determined by two \"shape \\nparameters\". other commonly used distributions include the uniform, normal and lognormal. in these charts \\nthe horizontal (x) axes represent possible values of time or cost and the vertical (y) axes represent relative \\nlikelihood. \\nfigure 11-4. example of a risk breakdown structure (rbs)\\n•\\t definitions of risk probability and impact. the quality and credibility of the risk analysis requires that \\ndifferent levels of risk probability and impact be defined that are specific to the project context. general \\ndefinitions of probability levels and impact levels are tailored to the individual project during the plan \\nrisk management process for use in subsequent processes. table 11-1 is an example of definitions of \\nnegative impacts that could be used in evaluating risk impacts related to four project objectives. (similar \\ntables may be established with a positive impact perspective). table 11-1 illustrates both relative and \\nnumerical (in this case, nonlinear) approaches.\\n•\\t probability and impact matrix. a probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the probability \\nof each risk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. risks are prioritized \\naccording to their potential implications for having an effect on the project objectives. a typical \\napproach to prioritizing risks is to use a look-up table or a probability and impact matrix. the specific \\ncombinations of probability and impact that lead to a risk being rated as “high,” “moderate,” or “low” \\nimportance are usually set by the organization.\\n•\\t revised stakeholders’ tolerances. stakeholders’ tolerances, as they apply to the specific project, may \\nbe revised in the plan risk management process.\\n•\\t reporting formats. reporting formats define how the outcomes of the risk management process will \\nbe documented, analyzed, and communicated. it describes the content and format of the risk register as \\nwell as any other risk reports required.\\n•\\t tracking. tracking documents how risk activities will be recorded for the benefit of the current project \\nand how risk management processes will be audited.\\n11.2 identify risks\\nidentify risks is the process of determining which risks may affect the project and documenting their \\ncharacteristics. the key benefit of this process is the documentation of existing risks and the knowledge and ability \\nit provides to the project team to anticipate events. the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process \\nare depicted in figure 11-5. figure 11-6 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\nparticipants in risk identification activities may include the following: project manager, project team members, \\nrisk management team (if assigned), customers, subject matter experts from outside the project team, end \\nusers, other project managers, stakeholders, and risk management experts. while these personnel are often key \\nparticipants for risk identification, all project personnel should be encouraged to identify potential risks.\\nidentify risks is an iterative process, because new risks may evolve or is known as the project progresses \\nthrough its life cycle. the frequency of iteration and participation in each cycle will vary by situation. the format of \\nthe risk statements should be consistent to ensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order \\nto support effective analysis and response development. the risk statement should support the ability to compare \\nthe relative effect of one risk against others on the project. the process should involve the project team so they can \\ndevelop and maintain a sense of ownership and responsibility for the risks and associated risk response actions. \\nstakeholders outside the project team may provide additional objective information.\\n11.2.1 identify risks: inputs\\n11.2.1.1 risk management plan \\ndescribed in section 11.1.3.1. key elements of the risk management plan that contribute to the identify risks \\nprocess are the assignments of roles and responsibilities, provision for risk management activities in the budget \\nand schedule, and categories of risk, which are sometimes expressed as a risk breakdown structure (figure 11-4).\\n11.2.1.2 cost management plan\\ndescribed in section 7.1.3.1. the cost management plan provides processes and controls that can be used to \\nhelp identify risks across the project.\\n11.2.1.3 schedule management plan\\ndescribed in section 6.1.3.1. the schedule management plan provides insight to project time/schedule \\nobjectives and expectations which may be impacted by risks (known and unknown).\\n11.2.1.4 quality management plan\\ndescribed in section 8.1.3.1. the quality management plan provides a baseline of quality measures and metrics \\nfor use in identifying risks.\\n11.2.1.5 human resource management plan\\ndescribed in section 9.1.3.1. the human resource management plan provides guidance on how project human \\nresources should be defined, staffed, managed, and eventually released. it can also contain roles and responsibilities, \\nproject organization charts, and the staffing management plan, which form a key input to identify risk process.\\n11.2.1.6 scope baseline\\ndescribed in section 5.4.3.1. project assumptions are found in the project scope statement. uncertainty in \\nproject assumptions should be evaluated as potential causes of project risk.\\nthe wbs is a critical input to identifying risks as it facilitates an understanding of the potential risks at both \\nthe micro and macro levels. risks can be identified and subsequently tracked at summary, control account, and/or \\nwork package levels.\\n11.2.1.7 activity cost estimates\\ndescribed in section 7.2.3.1. activity cost estimate reviews are useful in identifying risks as they provide a \\nquantitative assessment of the likely cost to complete scheduled activities and ideally are expressed as a range, \\nwith the width of the range indicating the degree(s) of risk. the review may result in projections indicating the \\nestimate is either sufficient or insufficient to complete the activity .\\n11.2.1.8 activity duration estimates\\ndescribed in section 6.5.3.1. activity duration estimate reviews are useful in identifying risks related to the time \\nallowances for the activities or project as a whole, again with the width of the range of such estimates indicating \\nthe relative degree(s) of risk.\\n11.2.1.9 stakeholder register\\ndescribed in section 13.1.3.1. information about the stakeholders is useful for soliciting inputs to identify risks, \\nas this will ensure that key stakeholders, especially the stakeholder, sponsor, and customer are interviewed or \\notherwise participate during the identify risks process.\\n11.2.1.10 project documents\\nproject documents provide the project team with information about decisions that help better identify project \\nrisks. project documents improve cross-team and stakeholder communications and include:\\n•\\t project charter,\\n•\\t project schedule,\\n•\\t schedule network diagrams,\\n•\\t issue log,\\n•\\t quality checklist, and\\n•\\t other information proven to be valuable in identifying risks.\\n11.2.1.11 procurement documents\\ndefined in section 12.1.3.3. if the project requires external procurement of resources, procurement \\ndocuments is a key input to the identify risks process. the complexity and the level of detail of the \\n\\nprocurement documents should be consistent with the value of, and risks associated with, planned procurement.\\n11.2.1.12 enterprise environmental factors\\ndescribed in section 2.1.5. enterprise environmental factors that can influence the identify risks process \\ninclude:\\n•\\t published information include commercial databases,\\n•\\t academic studies,\\n•\\t published checklists,\\n•\\t benchmarking,\\n•\\t industry studies, and\\n•\\t risk attitudes.\\n11.2.1.13 organizational process assets\\ndescribed in section 2.1.4. organizational process assets that can influence the identify risks process include:\\n•\\t project files include actual data,\\n•\\t organizational and project process controls,\\n•\\t risk statement formats or templates, and\\n•\\t lessons learned.\\n11.2.2 identify risks: tools and techniques\\n11.2.2.1 documentation reviews\\na structured review of the project documentation may be performed include plans, assumptions, previous \\nproject files, agreements, and other information. the quality of the plans, as well as consistency between those \\nplans and the project requirements and assumptions, may be indicators of risk in the project.\\n11.2.2.2 information gathering techniques\\nexamples of information gathering techniques used in identifying risks can include:\\n•\\t brainstorming. the goal of brainstorming is to obtain a comprehensive list of project risks. the project \\nteam usually performs brainstorming, often with a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the \\nteam. ideas about project risk are generated under the leadership of a facilitator, either in a traditional \\nfree-form brainstorm session or structured mass interviewing techniques. categories of risk such as in a \\nrisk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework. risks are then identified and categorized by type \\nof risk and their definitions are refined.\\n•\\t delphi technique. the delphi technique is a way to reach a consensus of experts. project risk experts \\nparticipate in this technique anonymously. a facilitator uses a questionnaire to solicit ideas about the \\nimportant project risks. the responses are summarized and are then recirculated to the experts for \\nfurther comment. consensus may be reached in a few rounds of this process. the delphi technique helps \\nreduce bias in the data and keeps any one person from having undue influence on the outcome.\\n•\\t interviewing. interviewing experienced project participants, stakeholders, and subject matter experts \\nhelps to identify risks.\\n•\\t root cause analysis. root-cause analysis is a specific technique used to identify a problem, discover \\nthe underlying causes that lead to it, and develop preventive action.\\n11.2.2.3 checklist analysis\\nrisk identification checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been \\naccumulated from previous similar projects and from other sources of information. the lowest level of the rbs \\ncan also be used as a risk checklist. while a checklist may be quick and simple, it is impossible to build an \\nexhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid the effort of proper risk \\nidentification. the team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist. additionally, the checklist \\nshould be pruned from time to time to remove or archive related items. the checklist should be reviewed during \\nproject closure to incorporate new lessons learned and improve it for use on future projects.\\n11.2.2.4 assumptions analysis\\n\\nevery project and its plan is conceived and developed based on a set of hypotheses, scenarios, or assumptions. \\nassumptions analysis explores the validity of assumptions as they apply to the project. it identifies risks to the \\nproject from inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions.\\n11.2.2.5 diagramming techniques\\nrisk diagramming techniques may include:\\n•\\t cause and effect diagrams. these are also known as ishikawa or fishbone diagrams and are useful for \\nidentifying causes of risks.\\n•\\t system or process flow charts. these show how various elements of a system interrelate and the \\nmechanism of causation.\\n•\\t influence diagrams. these are graphical representations of situations showing causal influences, time \\nordering of events, and other relationships among variables and outcomes, as shown in figure 11-7.\\n11.2.2.6 swot analysis\\nthis technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (swot) \\nperspectives to increase the breadth of identified risks by including internally generated risks. the technique starts \\nwith identification of strengths and weaknesses of the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, \\nor the business area in general. swot analysis then identifies any opportunities for the project that arise from \\norganizational strengths, and any threats arising from organizational weaknesses. the analysis also examines \\nthe degree to which organizational strengths offset threats, as well as identifying opportunities that may serve to \\novercome weaknesses.\\n11.2.2.7 expert judgment\\nrisks may be identified directly by experts with relevant experience with similar projects or business areas. \\nsuch experts should be identified by the project manager and invited to consider all aspects of the project and \\nsuggest possible risks based on their previous experience and areas of expertise. the experts’ bias should be taken \\ninto account in this process.\\n11.2.3 identify risks: outputs\\n11.2.3.1 risk register\\nthe primary output from identify risks is the initial entry into the risk register. the risk register is a document \\nin which the results of risk analysis and risk response planning are recorded. it contains the outcomes of the other \\nrisk management processes as they are conducted, resulting in an increase in the level and type of information \\ncontained in the risk register over time. the preparation of the risk register begins in the identify risks process \\n\\nwith the following information, and then is available to other project management and risk management \\nprocesses.risk_register include:\\n•\\t list of identified risks. the identified risks are described in as much detail as is reasonable. a \\nstructure for describing risks using risk statements may be applied, for example, event may occur \\ncausing impact, or if cause exists, event may occur leading to effect. in addition to the list of \\nidentified risks, the root causes of those risks may is more evident. these are the fundamental \\nconditions or events that may give rise to one or more identified risks. they should be recorded and \\nused to support future risk identification for this and other projects.\\n•\\t list of potential responses. potential responses to a risk may sometimes be identified during the identify \\nrisks process. these responses, if identified in this process, should be used as inputs to the plan risk \\nresponses process.\\n11.3 perform qualitative risk analysis\\nperform qualitative risk analysis is the process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action by assessing \\nand combining their probability of occurrence and impact. the key benefit of this process is that it enables project \\nmanagers to reduce the level of uncertainty and to focus on high-priority risks. the inputs, tools and techniques, \\nand outputs of this process are depicted in figure 11-8. figure 11-9 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\nperform qualitative risk analysis assesses the priority of identified risks using their relative probability or \\nlikelihood of occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur, as well as other \\nfactors such as the time frame for response and the organization risk tolerance associated with the project \\nconstraints of cost, schedule, scope, and quality. such assessments reflect the risk attitude of the project \\nteam and other stakeholders. effective assessment therefore requires explicit identification and management \\nof the risk approaches of key participants in the perform qualitative risk analysis process. where these risk \\napproaches introduce bias into the assessment of identified risks, attention should be paid to identifying bias \\nand correcting for it.\\nestablishing definitions of the levels of probability and impact can reduce the influence of bias. the time \\ncriticality of risk-related actions may magnify the importance of a risk. an evaluation of the quality of the \\navailable information on project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of the risk importance to the project.\\nperform qualitative risk analysis is usually a rapid and cost-effective means of establishing priorities for plan \\nrisk responses and lays the foundation for perform quantitative risk analysis, if required. the perform qualitative \\nrisk analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle, as defined in the project risk \\nmanagement plan. this process can lead into perform quantitative risk analysis (section 11.4) or directly into plan \\n\\nrisk responses (section 11.5).\\n11.3.1 perform qualitative risk analysis: inputs\\n11.3.1.1 risk management plan\\ndescribed in section 11.1.3.1. key elements of the risk management plan used in the perform qualitative risk \\nanalysis process include roles and responsibilities for conducting risk management, budgets, schedule activities \\nfor risk management, risk categories, definitions of probability and impact, the probability and impact matrix, \\nand revised stakeholders’ risk tolerances. these inputs are usually tailored to the project during the plan risk \\nmanagement process. if they are not available, they may be developed during the perform qualitative risk analysis \\nprocess.\\n11.3.1.2 scope baseline\\ndescribed in section 5.4.3.1. projects of a common or recurrent type tend to have more well-understood risks. \\nprojects using state-of-the-art or first-of-its-kind technology, and highly complex projects, tend to have more \\nuncertainty. this can be evaluated by examining the scope baseline.\\n11.3.1.3 risk register\\ndescribed in section 11.2.3.1. the risk register contains the information that will be used to assess and prioritize \\nrisks.\\n11.3.1.4 enterprise environmental factors\\ndescribed in section 2.1.5.entreprise_environmental_factors provide context_to_risk such as:\\n•\\t industry studies of similar projects by risk specialists, and\\n•\\t risk databases that may be available from industry or proprietary sources.\\n11.3.1.5 organizational process assets\\ndescribed in section 2.1.4. the organizational process assets that can influence the perform qualitative risk \\nanalysis process include information on prior, similar completed projects.\\n11.3.2 perform qualitative risk analysis: tools and techniques\\n11.3.2.1 risk probability and impact assessment\\nrisk probability assessment investigates the likelihood that each specific risk will occur. risk impact \\nassessment investigates the potential effect on a project objective such as schedule, cost, quality, or performance, \\nincluding both negative effects for threats and positive effects for opportunities.\\nprobability and impact are assessed for each identified risk. risks can be assessed in interviews or meetings \\nwith participants selected for their familiarity with the risk categories on the agenda. project team members and \\nknowledgeable persons external to the project are included.\\nthe level of probability for each risk and its impact on each objective is evaluated during the interview or meeting. \\nexplanatory detail include assumptions justifying the levels assigned, are also recorded. risk probabilities \\nand impacts are rated according to the definitions given in the risk management plan. risks with low ratings of \\nprobability and impact will be included within the risk register as part of the watch list for future monitoring.\\n11.3.2.2 probability and impact matrix\\nrisks can be prioritized for further quantitative analysis and planning risk responses based on their risk rating. \\nratings are assigned to risks based on their assessed probability and impact. evaluation of each risk importance \\nand priority for attention is typically conducted using a look-up table or a probability and impact matrix. such a \\nmatrix specifies combinations of probability and impact that lead to rating the risks as low, moderate, or high \\npriority. descriptive terms or numeric values can be used depending on organizational preference.\\neach risk is rated on its probability of occurrence and impact on an objective if it does occur. the organization \\nshould determine which combinations of probability and impact result in a classification of high risk, moderate risk, \\nand low risk. in a black-and-white matrix, these conditions are denoted using different shades of gray. specifically \\nin figure 11-10, the dark gray area (with the largest numbers) represents high risk: the medium gray area (with \\nthe smallest numbers) represents low risk, and the light gray area (with in-between numbers) represents moderate \\nrisk. usually, these risk-rating rules are specified by the organization in advance of the project and included in \\norganizational process assets. risk rating rules can be tailored in the plan risk management process to the specific \\nproject.\\nas illustrated in figure 11-10, an organization can rate a risk separately for each objective (such as cost, time, \\nand scope). in addition, it may develop ways to determine one overall rating for each risk. finally, opportunities \\nand threats are handled in the same matrix using definitions of the different levels of impact that are appropriate \\nfor each.\\nthe risk score helps guide risk responses. for example, risks that have a negative impact on objectives, \\notherwise known as threats if they occur, and that are in the high-risk (dark gray) zone of the matrix, may require \\npriority action and aggressive response strategies. threats found in the low-risk (medium gray) zone may not \\nrequire proactive management action beyond being placed in the risk register as part of the watch list or adding \\na contingency reserve. similarly for opportunities, those in the high-risk (dark gray) zone, which may be obtained \\nmost easily and offer the greatest benefit, should be targeted first. opportunities in the low-risk (medium gray) zone \\nshould be monitored.\\n11.3.2.3 risk data quality assessment\\nrisk data quality assessment is a technique to evaluate the degree to which the data about risks is useful \\nfor risk management. it involves examining the degree to which the risk is understood and the accuracy, quality, \\nreliability, and integrity of the data about the risk.\\nthe use of low-quality risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis of little use to the project. if data quality is \\nunacceptable, it may be necessary to gather better data. often, the collection of information about risks is difficult, \\nand consumes more time and resources than originally planned. the values used in the example in figure 11-10 \\nare representative. the numbers of steps in the scale are usually established when defining the risk attitude of the \\norganization.\\n11.3.2.4 risk categorization\\nrisks to the project can be categorized by sources of risk (such as using the rbs), the area of the project affected \\n(such as using the wbs), or other useful categories (such as project phase) to determine the areas of the project most \\nexposed to the effects of uncertainty. risks can also be categorized by common root causes. this technique helps \\ndetermine work packages, activities, project phases or even roles in the project, which can lead to the development \\nof effective risk responses.\\n11.3.2.5 risk urgency assessment\\nrisks requiring near-term responses may be considered more urgent to address. indicators of priority may \\ninclude probability of detecting the risk, time to affect a risk response, symptoms and warning signs, and the \\nrisk rating. in some qualitative analyses, the assessment of risk urgency is combined with the risk ranking that is \\ndetermined from the probability and impact matrix to give a final risk severity rating.\\n11.3.2.6 expert judgment\\nexpert judgment is required to assess the probability and impact of each risk to determine its location in \\nthe matrix shown in figure 11-10. experts generally are those having experience with similar, recent projects. \\ngathering expert judgment is often accomplished with the use of risk facilitation workshops or interviews. the \\nexperts’ bias should be taken into account in this process.\\n11.3.3 perform qualitative risk analysis: outputs\\n\\n11.3.3.1 project documents updates\\nproject documents that may be updated include:\\n•\\t risk  register  updates.  as  new  information  is  available  through  the  qualitative  risk \\nassessment, the risk register is updated. updates to the risk register may include assessments \\nof probability and impacts for each risk, risk ranking or scores, risk urgency information or risk \\ncategorization, and a watch list for low probability risks or risks requiring further analysis.\\n•\\t assumptions log updates. as new information is available through the qualitative risk \\nassessment, assumptions could change. the assumptions log needs to be revisited to accommodate \\nthis new information. assumptions may be incorporated into the project scope statement or in a \\nseparate assumptions log.\\n11.4 perform quantitative risk analysis\\nperform quantitative risk analysis is the process of numerically analyzing the effect of identified risks on overall \\nproject objectives. the key benefit of this process is that it produces quantitative risk information to support decision \\nmaking in order to reduce project uncertainty. the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are \\ndepicted in figure 11-11. figure 11-12 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\nperform quantitative risk analysis is performed on risks that have been prioritized by the perform qualitative \\nrisk analysis process as potentially and substantially impacting the project competing demands. the perform \\nquantitative risk analysis process analyzes the effect of those risks on project objectives. it is used mostly to \\nevaluate the aggregate effect of all risks affecting the project. when the risks drive the quantitative analysis, the \\nprocess may be used to assign a numerical priority rating to those risks individually.\\nperform quantitative risk analysis generally follows the perform qualitative risk analysis process. in some \\ncases, it may not be possible to execute the perform quantitative risk analysis process due to lack of sufficient \\ndata to develop appropriate models. the project manager should exercise expert judgment to determine the need \\nfor and the viability of quantitative risk analysis. the availability of time and budget, and the need for qualitative or \\nquantitative statements about risk and impacts, will determine which method(s) to use on any particular project. \\nperform quantitative risk analysis should be repeated, as needed, as part of the control risks process to determine \\nif the overall project risk has been satisfactorily decreased. trends may indicate the need for more or less focus on \\nappropriate risk management activities.\\n11.4.1 perform quantitative risk analysis: inputs\\n11.4.1.1 risk management plan\\ndescribed in section 11.1.3.1. the risk management plan provides guidelines, methods, and tools to be used in \\nquantitative risk analysis.\\n\\n11.4.1.2 cost management plan\\ndescribed in section 7.1.3.1. the cost management plan provides guidelines on establishing and managing risk \\nreserves.\\n11.4.1.3 schedule management plan\\ndescribed in section 6.1.3.1. the schedule management plan provides guidelines on establishing and managing \\nrisk reserves.\\n11.4.1.4 risk register\\ndescribed in section 11.2.3.1. the risk register is used as a reference point for performing quantitative risk \\nanalysis.\\n11.4.1.5 enterprise environmental factors\\ndescribed in section 2.1.5.entreprise_environmental_factors provide context_to_risk such as:\\n•\\t industry studies of similar projects by risk specialists, and\\n•\\t risk databases that may be available from industry or proprietary sources.\\n11.4.1.6 organizational process assets\\ndescribed in section 2.1.4. the organizational process assets that can influence the perform quantitative risk \\nanalysis process include information from prior, similar completed projects.\\n11.4.2 perform quantitative risk analysis: tools and techniques\\n11.4.2.1 data gathering and representation techniques\\n•\\t interviewing. interviewing techniques draw on experience and historical data to quantify the probability \\nand impact of risks on project objectives. the information needed depends upon the type of probability \\ndistributions that will be used. for instance, information would be gathered on the optimistic (low), \\npessimistic (high), and most likely scenarios for some commonly used distributions. examples of three-\\npoint estimates for cost are shown in figure 11-13. additional information on three-point estimates \\nappears in estimate activity durations (section 6.5) and estimate costs (section 7.2). documenting the \\nrationale of the risk ranges and the assumptions behind them are important components of the risk \\ninterview because they can provide insight on the reliability and credibility of the analysis.\\n•\\t probability distributions. continuous probability distributions, which are used extensively in modeling \\nand simulation, represent the uncertainty in values such as durations of schedule activities and costs \\nof project components. discrete distributions can be used to represent uncertain events such as the \\noutcome of a test or a possible scenario in a decision tree. two examples of widely used continuous \\ndistributions are shown in figure 11-14. these distributions depict shapes that are compatible with the \\ndata typically developed during the quantitative risk analysis. uniform distributions can be used if there \\nis no obvious value that is more likely than any other between specified high and low bounds such as in \\nthe early concept stage of design.\\n11.4.2.2 quantitative risk analysis and modeling techniques\\ncommonly used techniques use both event-oriented and project-oriented analysis approaches include:\\n•\\t sensitivity analysis. sensitivity analysis helps to determine which risks have the most potential \\nimpact on the project. it helps to understand how the variations in project objectives correlate with \\nvariations in different uncertainties. conversely, it examines the extent to which the uncertainty of \\neach project element affects the objective being studied when all other uncertain elements are held at \\ntheir baseline values. one typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram (figure 11-15), \\nwhich is useful for comparing relative importance and impact of variables that have a high degree of \\nuncertainty to those that are more stable. the tornado diagram is also helpful in analyzing risk-taking \\nscenarios enabled on specific risks whose quantitative analysis highlights possible benefits greater \\nthan corresponding identified negative impacts. a tornado diagram is a special type of bar chart used \\nin sensitivity analysis for comparing the relative importance of the variables. in a tornado diagram, \\nthe y-axis contains each type of uncertainty at base values, and the x-axis contains the spread or \\ncorrelation of the uncertainty to the studied output. in this figure, each uncertainty contains a horizontal \\nbar and is ordered vertically to show uncertainties with a decreasing spread from the base values.\\n•\\t expected monetary value analysis. expected monetary value (emv) analysis is a statistical concept \\nthat calculates the average outcome when the future includes scenarios that may or may not happen \\n. the emv of opportunities are generally expressed as positive values, \\nwhile those of threats are expressed as negative values. emv requires a risk-neutral assumption—\\nneither risk averse nor risk seeking. emv for a project is calculated by multiplying the value of each \\npossible outcome by its probability of occurrence and adding the products together. a common use of \\nthis type of analysis is a decision tree analysis (figure 11-16).\\n•\\t modeling and simulation. a project simulation uses a model that translates the specified detailed \\nuncertainties of the project into their potential impact on project objectives. simulations are typically \\nperformed using the monte carlo technique. in a simulation, the project model is computed many times \\n(iterated), with the input values (such as cost estimates or activity durations) chosen at random for each \\niteration from the probability distributions of these variables. a histogram (such as total cost or completion \\ndate) is calculated from the iterations. for a cost risk analysis, a simulation uses cost estimates. for a \\nschedule risk analysis, the schedule network diagram and duration estimates are used. the output from a \\ncost risk simulation using the three-element model and risk ranges is shown in figure 11-17. it illustrates \\nthe respective probability of achieving specific cost targets. similar curves can be developed for other \\nproject objectives.\\n11.4.2.3 expert judgment\\nexpert judgment (ideally using experts with relevant, recent experience) is required to identify potential cost \\nand schedule impacts, to evaluate probability, and to define inputs such as probability distributions into the tools.\\nexpert judgment also comes into play in the interpretation of the data. experts should be able to identify the \\nweaknesses of the tools as well as their strengths. experts may determine when a specific tool may or may not be \\nmore appropriate given the organization capabilities and culture.\\n11.4.3 perform quantitative risk analysis: outputs\\n11.4.3.1 project documents updates\\nproject documents are updated with information resulting from quantitative risk analysis. for example, risk \\nregister updates could include:\\n•\\t probabilistic analysis of the project. estimates are made of potential project schedule and cost  \\noutcomes listing the possible completion dates and costs with their associated confidence levels. \\nthis output, often expressed as a cumulative frequency distribution, is used with stakeholder risk \\ntolerances to permit quantification of the cost and time contingency reserves. such contingency \\nreserves are needed to bring the risk of overrunning stated project objectives to a level acceptable to \\nthe organization.\\n•\\t probability of achieving cost and time objectives. with the risks facing the project, the probability \\nof achieving project objectives under the current plan can be estimated using quantitative risk analysis \\nresults. for instance, in figure 11-17, the likelihood of achieving the cost estimate of us$41 million is \\nabout 12%.\\n•\\t prioritized list of quantified risks. this list includes those risks that pose the greatest threat or present \\nthe greatest opportunity to the project. these include the risks that may have the greatest effect on cost \\ncontingency and those that are most likely to influence the critical path. these risks may be evaluated, in \\nsome cases, through a tornado diagram generated as a result of the simulation analysis.\\n•\\t trends in quantitative risk analysis results. as the analysis is repeated, a trend may is apparent \\nthat leads to conclusions affecting risk responses. organizational historical information on project schedule, \\ncost, quality, and performance should reflect new insights gained through the perform quantitative risk \\nanalysis process. such history may take the form of a quantitative risk analysis report. this report may \\nbe separate from, or linked to, the risk register.\\n11.5 plan risk responses\\nplan risk responses is the process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and to reduce \\nthreats to project objectives. the key benefit of this process is that it addresses the risks by their priority, inserting \\nresources and activities into the budget, schedule and project management plan as needed. the inputs, tools and \\ntechniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in figure 11-18. figure 11-19 depicts the data flow diagram \\nof the process.\\nthe plan risk responses process follows the perform quantitative risk analysis process (if used). each risk \\nresponse requires an understanding of the mechanism by which it will address the risk. this is the mechanism \\nused to analyze if the risk response plan is having the desired effect. it includes the identification and assignment \\nof one person (an owner for risk response) to take responsibility for each agreed-to and funded risk response. risk \\nresponses should be appropriate for the significance of the risk, cost-effective in meeting the challenge, realistic \\nwithin the project context, agreed upon by all parties involved, and owned by a responsible person. selecting the \\noptimum risk response from several options is often required.\\nthe plan risk responses process presents commonly used approaches to planning responses to the risks. \\nrisks include threats and opportunities that can affect project success, and responses are discussed for each.\\n11.5.1 plan risk responses: inputs\\n11.5.1.1 risk management plan\\nimportant components of the risk management plan include roles and responsibilities, risk analysis definitions, \\n\\ntiming for reviews (and for eliminating risks from review), and risk thresholds for low, moderate, and high risks. risk \\nthresholds help identify those risks for which specific responses are needed.\\n11.5.1.2 risk register\\nthe risk register refers to identified risks, root causes of risks, lists of potential responses, risk owners, symptoms \\nand warning signs, the relative rating or priority list of project risks, risks requiring responses in the near term, risks \\nfor additional analysis and response, trends in qualitative analysis results, and a watch list, which is a list of low-\\npriority risks within the risk register.\\n11.5.2 plan risk responses: tools and techniques\\nseveral risk response strategies are available. the strategy or mix of strategies most likely to be effective \\nshould be selected for each risk. risk analysis tools such as decision tree analysis (section 11.4.2.2), can be \\nused to choose the most appropriate responses. specific actions are developed to implement that strategy, \\nincluding primary and backup strategies, as necessary. a fallback plan can be developed for implementation \\nif the selected strategy turns out not to be fully effective or if an accepted risk occurs. secondary risks should \\nalso be reviewed. secondary risks are risks that arise as a direct result of implementing a risk response. a \\ncontingency reserve is often allocated for time or cost. if developed, it may include identification of the conditions \\nthat trigger its use.\\n11.5.2.1 strategies for negative risks or threats\\nthree strategies, which typically deal with threats or risks that may have negative impacts on project objectives \\nif they occur, are: avoid, transfer, and mitigate. the fourth strategy, accept, can be used for negative risks or threats \\nas well as positive risks or opportunities. each of these risk response strategies have varied and unique influence \\non the risk condition. these strategies should be chosen to match the risk probability and impact on the project \\noverall objectives. avoidance and mitigation strategies are usually good strategies for critical risks with high impact, \\nwhile transference and acceptance are usually good strategies for threats that are less critical and with low overall \\nimpact. strategies_for_negative_risks_or_threats include:\\n•\\t avoid. risk avoidance is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to eliminate the threat or \\nprotect the project from its impact. it usually involves changing the project management plan to eliminate \\nthe threat entirely. the project manager may also isolate the project objectives from the risk impact or \\nchange the objective that is in jeopardy. examples of this include extending the schedule, changing the \\nstrategy, or reducing scope. the most radical avoidance strategy is to shut down the project entirely. \\nsome risks that arise early in the project can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, \\nimproving communication, or acquiring expertise.\\n•\\t transfer. risk transference is a risk response strategy whereby the project team shifts the impact of \\na threat to a third party, together with ownership of the response. transferring the risk simply gives \\nanother party responsibility for its management—it does not eliminate it. transferring does not mean \\ndisowning the risk by transferring it to a later project or another person without his or her knowledge or \\nagreement. risk transference nearly always involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on \\nthe risk. transferring liability for risk is most effective in dealing with financial risk exposure. transference \\ntools can be quite diverse and include the use of insurance, performance bonds, \\nwarranties, guarantees, etc. contracts or agreements may be used to transfer liability for specified risks \\nto another party. for example, when a buyer has capabilities that the seller does not possess, it may be \\nprudent to transfer some work and its concurrent risk contractually back to the buyer. in many cases, use \\nof a cost-plus contract may transfer the cost risk to the buyer, while a fixed-price contract may transfer \\nrisk to the seller.\\n•\\t mitigate. risk mitigation is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to reduce the \\nprobability of occurrence or impact of a risk. it implies a reduction in the probability and/or impact of an \\nadverse risk to be within acceptable threshold limits. taking early action to reduce the probability and/or \\nimpact of a risk occurring on the project is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the \\nrisk has occurred. adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable \\nsupplier are examples of mitigation actions. mitigation may require prototype development to reduce the \\nrisk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product. where it is not possible to reduce \\nprobability, a mitigation response might address the risk impact by targeting linkages that determine the \\nseverity. for example, designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the \\noriginal component.\\n•\\t accept. risk acceptance is a risk response strategy whereby the project team decides to acknowledge \\nthe risk and not take any action unless the risk occurs. this strategy is adopted where it is not possible \\nor cost-effective to address a specific risk in any other way. this strategy indicates that the project \\nteam has decided not to change the project management plan to deal with a risk, or is unable to identify \\nany other suitable response strategy. this strategy can be either passive or active. passive acceptance \\nrequires no action except to document the strategy, leaving the project team to deal with the risks as \\n\\nthey occur, and to periodically review the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly. the \\nmost common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve include amounts of \\ntime, money, or resources to handle the risks.\\n11.5.2.2 strategies for positive risks or opportunities\\nthree of the four responses are suggested to deal with risks with potentially positive impacts on project objectives. \\nthe fourth strategy, accept, can be used for negative risks or threats as well as positive risks or opportunities. strategies_for_positive_risks_or_opportunities include:\\n•\\t exploit. the exploit strategy may be selected for risks with positive impacts where the organization wishes \\nto ensure that the opportunity is realized. this strategy seeks to eliminate the uncertainty associated with \\na particular upside risk by ensuring the opportunity definitely happens. examples of directly exploiting \\nresponses include assigning an organization most talented resources to the project to reduce the time \\nto completion or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration required to \\nrealize project objectives.\\n•\\t enhance. the enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or the positive impacts of an \\nopportunity. identifying and maximizing key drivers of these positive-impact risks may increase the \\nprobability of their occurrence. examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to \\nan activity to finish early.\\n•\\t share. sharing a positive risk involves allocating some or all of the ownership of the opportunity to a \\nthird party who is best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project. examples of sharing \\nactions include forming risk-sharing partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures, \\nwhich can be established with the express purpose of taking advantage of the opportunity so that all \\nparties gain from their actions.\\n•\\t accept. accepting an opportunity is being willing to take advantage of the opportunity if it arises, but \\nnot actively pursuing it.\\n11.5.2.3 contingent response strategies\\nsome responses are designed for use only if certain events occur. for some risks, it is appropriate for \\nthe project team to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predefined conditions, if \\nit is believed that there will be sufficient warning to implement the plan. events that trigger the contingency \\nresponse such as missing intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with a supplier, should be defined \\nand tracked. risk responses identified using this technique are often called contingency plans or fallback plans \\nand include identified triggering events that set the plans in effect.\\n11.5.2.4 expert judgment\\nexpert judgment is input from knowledgeable parties pertaining to the actions to be taken on a specific and \\ndefined risk. expertise may be provided by any group or person with specialized education, knowledge, skill, \\nexperience, or training in establishing risk responses.\\n11.5.3 plan risk responses: outputs\\n11.5.3.1 project management plan updates\\nelements of the project management plan that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include:\\n•\\t schedule management plan. the schedule management plan is updated to reflect changes in process \\nand practice driven by the risk responses. this may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to \\nresource loading and leveling, as well as updates to the schedule strategy.\\n•\\t cost management plan. the cost management plan is updated to reflect changes in process and \\npractice driven by the risk responses. this may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to \\ncost accounting, tracking, and reports, as well as updates to the budget strategy and how contingency \\nreserves are consumed.\\n•\\t quality management plan. the quality management plan is updated to reflect changes in process \\nand practice driven by the risk responses. this may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to \\nrequirements, quality assurance, or quality control, as well as updates to the requirements documentation.\\n•\\t procurement management plan. the procurement management plan may be updated to reflect \\nchanges in strategy such as alterations in the make-or-buy decision or contract type(s) driven by the risk \\nresponses.\\n•\\t human resource management plan. the staffing management plan, part of the human resource \\nmanagement plan, is updated to reflect changes in project organizational structure and resource \\n\\napplications driven by the risk responses. this may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to \\nstaff allocation, as well as updates to the resource loading.\\n•\\t scope baseline. because of new, modified or omitted work generated by the risk responses, the scope \\nbaseline may be updated to reflect those changes.\\n•\\t schedule baseline. because of new work (or omitted work) generated by the risk responses, the schedule \\nbaseline may be updated to reflect those changes.\\n•\\t cost baseline. because of new work (or omitted work) generated by the risk responses, the cost baseline \\nmay be updated to reflect those changes.\\n11.5.3.2 project documents updates\\nin the plan risk responses process, several project documents are updated as needed. for example, when \\nappropriate risk responses are chosen and agreed upon, they are included in the risk register. the risk register \\nshould be written to a level of detail that corresponds with the priority ranking and the planned response. often, the \\nhigh and moderate risks are addressed in detail. risks judged to be of low priority are included in a watch list for \\nperiodic monitoring. updates to the risk register can include:\\n•\\t risk owners and assigned responsibilities;\\n•\\t agreed-upon response strategies;\\n•\\t specific actions to implement the chosen response strategy;\\n•\\t trigger conditions, symptoms, and warning signs of a risk occurrence;\\n•\\t budget and schedule activities required to implement the chosen responses;\\n•\\t contingency plans and triggers that call for their execution;\\n•\\t fallback plans for use as a reaction to a risk that has occurred and the primary response proves to be \\ninadequate;\\n•\\t residual risks that are expected to remain after planned responses have been taken, as well as those that \\nhave been deliberately accepted;\\n•\\t secondary risks that arise as a direct outcome of implementing a risk response; and\\n•\\t contingency reserves that are calculated based on the quantitative risk analysis of the project and the \\norganization risk thresholds.\\nother project documents updated could include:\\n•\\t assumptions log updates. as new information is available through the application of risk \\nresponses, assumptions could change. the assumptions log needs to be revisited to accommodate this \\nnew information.\\n•\\t technical documentation updates. as new information is available through the application \\nof risk responses, technical approaches and physical deliverables may change. any supporting \\ndocumentation needs to be revisited to accommodate this new information.\\n•\\t change requests. planning for possible risk responses can often result in recommendations for changes \\nto the resources, activities, cost estimates, and other items identified during other planning processes. \\nwhen such recommendations are identified, change requests are generated and processed through the \\nperform integrated change control process.\\n11.6 control risks\\ncontrol risks is the process of implementing risk response plans, tracking identified risks, monitoring residual \\nrisks, identifying new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project. the key benefit of \\nthis process is that it improves efficiency of the risk approach throughout the project life cycle to continuously \\noptimize risk responses. the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in figure 11-20. \\nfigure 11-21 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\nplanned risk responses that are included in the risk register are executed during the life cycle of the project, but \\nthe project work should be continuously monitored for new, changing, and outdated risks.\\nthe control risks process applies techniques such as variance and trend analysis, which require the use of \\nperformance information generated during project execution. other purposes of the control risks process are to \\ndetermine if:\\n•\\t project assumptions are still valid,\\n•\\t analysis shows an assessed risk has changed or can be retired,\\n•\\t risk management policies and procedures are being followed, and\\n•\\t contingency reserves for cost or schedule should be modified in alignment with the current risk \\nassessment.\\ncontrol risks can involve choosing alternative strategies, executing a contingency or fallback plan, taking \\ncorrective action, and modifying the project management plan. the risk response owner reports periodically to the \\nproject manager on the effectiveness of the plan, any unanticipated effects, and any correction needed to handle \\nthe risk appropriately. control risks also includes updating the organizational process assets include project \\nlessons learned databases and risk management templates, for the benefit of future projects.\\n11.6.1 control risks: inputs\\n11.6.1.1 project management plan\\ndescribed in section 4.2.3.1. the project management plan, which includes the risk management plan, provides \\nguidance for risk monitoring and controlling.\\n11.6.1.2 risk register\\nthe risk register has key inputs that include identified risks and risk owners, agreed-upon risk responses, \\ncontrol actions for assessing the effectiveness of response plans, risk responses, specific implementation actions, \\nsymptoms and warning signs of risk, residual and secondary risks, a watch list of low-priority risks, and the time \\nand cost contingency reserves. the watch list is within the risk register and provides a list of low-priority risks.\\n11.6.1.3 work performance data\\ndescribed in section 4.3.3.2. work_performance_data related to performance_results.work_performance_data include:\\n•\\t deliverable status,\\n•\\t schedule progress, and\\n•\\t costs incurred.\\n11.6.1.4 work performance reports\\ndescribed in section 4.4.3.2. work performance reports take information from performance measurements \\nand analyze it to provide project work performance information including variance analysis, earned value data, and \\nforecasting data. these data points could be impactful in controlling performance related risks.\\n11.6.2 control risks: tools and techniques\\n\\n11.6.2.1 risk reassessment\\ncontrol risks often results in identification of new risks, reassessment of current risks, and the closing of risks \\nthat are outdated. project risk reassessments should be regularly scheduled. the amount and detail of repetition \\nthat are appropriate depends on how the project progresses relative to its objectives.\\n11.6.2.2 risk audits\\nrisk audits examine and document the effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with identified risks and their \\nroot causes, as well as the effectiveness of the risk management process. the project manager is responsible for \\nensuring that risk audits are performed at an appropriate frequency, as defined in the project risk management \\nplan. risk audits may be included during routine project review meetings, or the team may choose to hold separate \\nrisk audit meetings. the format for the audit and its objectives should be clearly defined before the audit is conducted.\\n11.6.2.3 variance and trend analysis\\nmany control processes employ variance analysis to compare the planned results to the actual results. for the \\npurposes of controlling risks, trends in the project execution should be reviewed using performance information. \\nearned value analysis and other methods of project variance and trend analysis may be used for monitoring overall \\nproject performance. outcomes from these analyses may forecast potential deviation of the project at completion \\nfrom cost and schedule targets. deviation from the baseline plan may indicate the potential impact of threats or \\nopportunities.\\n11.6.2.4 technical performance measurement\\ntechnical performance measurement compares technical accomplishments during project execution to the \\nschedule of technical achievement. it requires the definition of objective, quantifiable measures of technical \\nperformance, which can be used to compare actual results against targets. such technical performance measures \\nmay include weight, transaction times, number of delivered defects, storage capacity, etc. deviation such as \\ndemonstrating more or less functionality than planned at a milestone, can help to forecast the degree of success \\nin achieving the project scope.\\n11.6.2.5 reserve analysis\\nthroughout execution of the project, some risks may occur with positive or negative impacts on budget or \\nschedule contingency reserves. reserve analysis compares the amount of the contingency reserves remaining to \\nthe amount of risk remaining at any time in the project in order to determine if the remaining reserve is adequate.\\n11.6.2.6 meetings\\nproject risk management should be an agenda item at periodic status meetings. the amount of time required \\nfor that item will vary, depending upon the risks that have been identified, their priority, and difficulty of response. \\nthe more often risk management is practiced, the easier it becomes. frequent discussions about risk make it more \\nlikely that people will identify risks and opportunities.\\n11.6.3 control risks: outputs\\n11.6.3.1 work performance information\\nwork performance information, as a control risks output, provides a mechanism to communicate and support \\nproject decision making.\\n11.6.3.2 change requests\\nimplementing contingency plans or workarounds sometimes results in a change request. change requests are \\nprepared and submitted to the perform integrated change control process (section 4.5). change_requests include:\\n•\\t recommended corrective actions. these are activities that realign the performance of the project \\nwork with the project management plan. they include contingency plans and workarounds. the latter \\nare responses that were not initially planned, but are required to deal with emerging risks that were \\npreviously unidentified or accepted passively. \\n•\\t recommended preventive actions. these are activities that ensure that future performance of the \\nproject work is aligned with the project management plan.\\n11.6.3.3 project management plan updates\\nif the approved change requests have an effect on the risk management processes, the corresponding component \\ndocuments of the project management plan are revised and reissued to reflect the approved changes. the elements \\nof the project management plan that may be updated are the same as those in the plan risk responses process.\\n11.6.3.4 project documents updates\\nproject documents that may be updated as a result of the control risk process include the \\nrisk register. risk register updates may include:\\n•\\t outcomes of risk reassessments, risk audits, and periodic risk reviews. these outcomes may \\ninclude identification of new risks, updates to probability, impact, priority, response plans, ownership, and \\nother elements of the risk register. outcomes can also include closing risks that are no longer applicable \\nand releasing their associated reserves.\\n•\\t actual outcomes of the project risks and of the risk responses. this information can help project \\nmanagers to plan for risk throughout their organizations, as well as on future projects. \\n11.6.3.5 organizational process assets updates\\nthe risk management processes produce information that may be used for future projects, and should be \\ncaptured in the organizational process assets. the organizational process assets that may be updated include, but \\nare not limited to:\\n•\\t templates for the risk management plan include the probability and impact matrix and risk register,\\n•\\t risk breakdown structure, and\\n•\\t lessons learned from the project risk management activities.\\nthese documents should be updated as needed and at project closure. final versions of the risk register and the \\nrisk management plan templates, checklists, and risk breakdown structure are included.\\n'"

       " 'plan risk responses is the process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and to reduce \\nthreats to project objectives. the key benefit of this process is that it addresses the risks by their priority, inserting \\nresources and activities into the budget, schedule and project management plan as needed. the inputs, tools and \\ntechniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in figure 11-18. figure 11-19 depicts the data flow diagram \\nof the process.\\nthe plan risk responses process follows the perform quantitative risk analysis process (if used). each risk \\nresponse requires an understanding of the mechanism by which it will address the risk. this is the mechanism \\nused to analyze if the risk response plan is having the desired effect. it includes the identification and assignment \\nof one person (an owner for risk response) to take responsibility for each agreed-to and funded risk response. risk \\nresponses should be appropriate for the significance of the risk, cost-effective in meeting the challenge, realistic \\nwithin the project context, agreed upon by all parties involved, and owned by a responsible person. selecting the \\noptimum risk response from several options is often required.\\nthe plan risk responses process presents commonly used approaches to planning responses to the risks. \\nrisks include threats and opportunities that can affect project success, and responses are discussed for each.\\n11.5.1 plan risk responses: inputs\\n11.5.1.1 risk management plan\\nimportant components of the risk management plan include roles and responsibilities, risk analysis definitions, \\n\\ntiming for reviews (and for eliminating risks from review), and risk thresholds for low, moderate, and high risks. risk \\nthresholds help identify those risks for which specific responses are needed.\\n11.5.1.2 risk register\\nthe risk register refers to identified risks, root causes of risks, lists of potential responses, risk owners, symptoms \\nand warning signs, the relative rating or priority list of project risks, risks requiring responses in the near term, risks \\nfor additional analysis and response, trends in qualitative analysis results, and a watch list, which is a list of low-\\npriority risks within the risk register.\\n11.5.2 plan risk responses: tools and techniques\\nseveral risk response strategies are available. the strategy or mix of strategies most likely to be effective \\nshould be selected for each risk. risk analysis tools such as decision tree analysis (section 11.4.2.2), can be \\nused to choose the most appropriate responses. specific actions are developed to implement that strategy, \\nincluding primary and backup strategies, as necessary. a fallback plan can be developed for implementation \\nif the selected strategy turns out not to be fully effective or if an accepted risk occurs. secondary risks should \\nalso be reviewed. secondary risks are risks that arise as a direct result of implementing a risk response. a \\ncontingency reserve is often allocated for time or cost. if developed, it may include identification of the conditions \\nthat trigger its use.\\n11.5.2.1 strategies for negative risks or threats\\nthree strategies, which typically deal with threats or risks that may have negative impacts on project objectives \\nif they occur, are: avoid, transfer, and mitigate. the fourth strategy, accept, can be used for negative risks or threats \\nas well as positive risks or opportunities. each of these risk response strategies have varied and unique influence \\non the risk condition. these strategies should be chosen to match the risk probability and impact on the project \\noverall objectives. avoidance and mitigation strategies are usually good strategies for critical risks with high impact, \\nwhile transference and acceptance are usually good strategies for threats that are less critical and with low overall \\nimpact. strategies_for_negative_risks_or_threats include:\\n•\\t avoid. risk avoidance is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to eliminate the threat or \\nprotect the project from its impact. it usually involves changing the project management plan to eliminate \\nthe threat entirely. the project manager may also isolate the project objectives from the risk impact or \\nchange the objective that is in jeopardy. examples of this include extending the schedule, changing the \\nstrategy, or reducing scope. the most radical avoidance strategy is to shut down the project entirely. \\nsome risks that arise early in the project can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, \\nimproving communication, or acquiring expertise.\\n•\\t transfer. risk transference is a risk response strategy whereby the project team shifts the impact of \\na threat to a third party, together with ownership of the response. transferring the risk simply gives \\nanother party responsibility for its management—it does not eliminate it. transferring does not mean \\ndisowning the risk by transferring it to a later project or another person without his or her knowledge or \\nagreement. risk transference nearly always involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on \\nthe risk. transferring liability for risk is most effective in dealing with financial risk exposure. transference \\ntools can be quite diverse and include the use of insurance, performance bonds, \\nwarranties, guarantees, etc. contracts or agreements may be used to transfer liability for specified risks \\nto another party. for example, when a buyer has capabilities that the seller does not possess, it may be \\nprudent to transfer some work and its concurrent risk contractually back to the buyer. in many cases, use \\nof a cost-plus contract may transfer the cost risk to the buyer, while a fixed-price contract may transfer \\nrisk to the seller.\\n•\\t mitigate. risk mitigation is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to reduce the \\nprobability of occurrence or impact of a risk. it implies a reduction in the probability and/or impact of an \\nadverse risk to be within acceptable threshold limits. taking early action to reduce the probability and/or \\nimpact of a risk occurring on the project is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the \\nrisk has occurred. adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable \\nsupplier are examples of mitigation actions. mitigation may require prototype development to reduce the \\nrisk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product. where it is not possible to reduce \\nprobability, a mitigation response might address the risk impact by targeting linkages that determine the \\nseverity. for example, designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the \\noriginal component.\\n•\\t accept. risk acceptance is a risk response strategy whereby the project team decides to acknowledge \\nthe risk and not take any action unless the risk occurs. this strategy is adopted where it is not possible \\nor cost-effective to address a specific risk in any other way. this strategy indicates that the project \\nteam has decided not to change the project management plan to deal with a risk, or is unable to identify \\nany other suitable response strategy. this strategy can be either passive or active. passive acceptance \\nrequires no action except to document the strategy, leaving the project team to deal with the risks as \\n\\nthey occur, and to periodically review the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly. the \\nmost common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve include amounts of \\ntime, money, or resources to handle the risks.\\n11.5.2.2 strategies for positive risks or opportunities\\nthree of the four responses are suggested to deal with risks with potentially positive impacts on project objectives. \\nthe fourth strategy, accept, can be used for negative risks or threats as well as positive risks or opportunities. strategies_for_positive_risks_or_opportunities include:\\n•\\t exploit. the exploit strategy may be selected for risks with positive impacts where the organization wishes \\nto ensure that the opportunity is realized. this strategy seeks to eliminate the uncertainty associated with \\na particular upside risk by ensuring the opportunity definitely happens. examples of directly exploiting \\nresponses include assigning an organization most talented resources to the project to reduce the time \\nto completion or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration required to \\nrealize project objectives.\\n•\\t enhance. the enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or the positive impacts of an \\nopportunity. identifying and maximizing key drivers of these positive-impact risks may increase the \\nprobability of their occurrence. examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to \\nan activity to finish early.\\n•\\t share. sharing a positive risk involves allocating some or all of the ownership of the opportunity to a \\nthird party who is best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project. examples of sharing \\nactions include forming risk-sharing partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures, \\nwhich can be established with the express purpose of taking advantage of the opportunity so that all \\nparties gain from their actions.\\n•\\t accept. accepting an opportunity is being willing to take advantage of the opportunity if it arises, but \\nnot actively pursuing it.\\n11.5.2.3 contingent response strategies\\nsome responses are designed for use only if certain events occur. for some risks, it is appropriate for \\nthe project team to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predefined conditions, if \\nit is believed that there will be sufficient warning to implement the plan. events that trigger the contingency \\nresponse such as missing intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with a supplier, should be defined \\nand tracked. risk responses identified using this technique are often called contingency plans or fallback plans \\nand include identified triggering events that set the plans in effect.\\n11.5.2.4 expert judgment\\nexpert judgment is input from knowledgeable parties pertaining to the actions to be taken on a specific and \\ndefined risk. expertise may be provided by any group or person with specialized education, knowledge, skill, \\nexperience, or training in establishing risk responses.\\n11.5.3 plan risk responses: outputs\\n11.5.3.1 project management plan updates\\nelements of the project management plan that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include:\\n•\\t schedule management plan. the schedule management plan is updated to reflect changes in process \\nand practice driven by the risk responses. this may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to \\nresource loading and leveling, as well as updates to the schedule strategy.\\n•\\t cost management plan. the cost management plan is updated to reflect changes in process and \\npractice driven by the risk responses. this may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to \\ncost accounting, tracking, and reports, as well as updates to the budget strategy and how contingency \\nreserves are consumed.\\n•\\t quality management plan. the quality management plan is updated to reflect changes in process \\nand practice driven by the risk responses. this may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to \\nrequirements, quality assurance, or quality control, as well as updates to the requirements documentation.\\n•\\t procurement management plan. the procurement management plan may be updated to reflect \\nchanges in strategy such as alterations in the make-or-buy decision or contract type(s) driven by the risk \\nresponses.\\n•\\t human resource management plan. the staffing management plan, part of the human resource \\nmanagement plan, is updated to reflect changes in project organizational structure and resource \\n\\napplications driven by the risk responses. this may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to \\nstaff allocation, as well as updates to the resource loading.\\n•\\t scope baseline. because of new, modified or omitted work generated by the risk responses, the scope \\nbaseline may be updated to reflect those changes.\\n•\\t schedule baseline. because of new work (or omitted work) generated by the risk responses, the schedule \\nbaseline may be updated to reflect those changes.\\n•\\t cost baseline. because of new work (or omitted work) generated by the risk responses, the cost baseline \\nmay be updated to reflect those changes.\\n11.5.3.2 project documents updates\\nin the plan risk responses process, several project documents are updated as needed. for example, when \\nappropriate risk responses are chosen and agreed upon, they are included in the risk register. the risk register \\nshould be written to a level of detail that corresponds with the priority ranking and the planned response. often, the \\nhigh and moderate risks are addressed in detail. risks judged to be of low priority are included in a watch list for \\nperiodic monitoring. updates to the risk register can include:\\n•\\t risk owners and assigned responsibilities;\\n•\\t agreed-upon response strategies;\\n•\\t specific actions to implement the chosen response strategy;\\n•\\t trigger conditions, symptoms, and warning signs of a risk occurrence;\\n•\\t budget and schedule activities required to implement the chosen responses;\\n•\\t contingency plans and triggers that call for their execution;\\n•\\t fallback plans for use as a reaction to a risk that has occurred and the primary response proves to be \\ninadequate;\\n•\\t residual risks that are expected to remain after planned responses have been taken, as well as those that \\nhave been deliberately accepted;\\n•\\t secondary risks that arise as a direct outcome of implementing a risk response; and\\n•\\t contingency reserves that are calculated based on the quantitative risk analysis of the project and the \\norganization risk thresholds.\\nother project documents updated could include:\\n•\\t assumptions log updates. as new information is available through the application of risk \\nresponses, assumptions could change. the assumptions log needs to be revisited to accommodate this \\nnew information.\\n•\\t technical documentation updates. as new information is available through the application \\nof risk responses, technical approaches and physical deliverables may change. any supporting \\ndocumentation needs to be revisited to accommodate this new information.\\n•\\t change requests. planning for possible risk responses can often result in recommendations for changes \\nto the resources, activities, cost estimates, and other items identified during other planning processes. \\nwhen such recommendations are identified, change requests are generated and processed through the \\nperform integrated change control process.\\n',\n",
       " 'perform quantitative risk analysis is the process of numerically analyzing the effect of identified risks on overall \\nproject objectives. the key benefit of this process is that it produces quantitative risk information to support decision \\nmaking in order to reduce project uncertainty. the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are \\ndepicted in figure 11-11. figure 11-12 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\nperform quantitative risk analysis is performed on risks that have been prioritized by the perform qualitative \\nrisk analysis process as potentially and substantially impacting the project competing demands. the perform \\nquantitative risk analysis process analyzes the effect of those risks on project objectives. it is used mostly to \\nevaluate the aggregate effect of all risks affecting the project. when the risks drive the quantitative analysis, the \\nprocess may be used to assign a numerical priority rating to those risks individually.\\nperform quantitative risk analysis generally follows the perform qualitative risk analysis process. in some \\ncases, it may not be possible to execute the perform quantitative risk analysis process due to lack of sufficient \\ndata to develop appropriate models. the project manager should exercise expert judgment to determine the need \\nfor and the viability of quantitative risk analysis. the availability of time and budget, and the need for qualitative or \\nquantitative statements about risk and impacts, will determine which method(s) to use on any particular project. \\nperform quantitative risk analysis should be repeated, as needed, as part of the control risks process to determine \\nif the overall project risk has been satisfactorily decreased. trends may indicate the need for more or less focus on \\nappropriate risk management activities.\\n11.4.1 perform quantitative risk analysis: inputs\\n11.4.1.1 risk management plan\\ndescribed in section 11.1.3.1. the risk management plan provides guidelines, methods, and tools to be used in \\nquantitative risk analysis.\\n\\n11.4.1.2 cost management plan\\ndescribed in section 7.1.3.1. the cost management plan provides guidelines on establishing and managing risk \\nreserves.\\n11.4.1.3 schedule management plan\\ndescribed in section 6.1.3.1. the schedule management

quantitative risk \\nanalysis.\\n11.4.1.5 enterprise environmental factors\\ndescribed in section 2.1.5.entreprise_environmental_factors provide context_to_risk such as:\\n•\\t industry studies of similar projects by risk specialists, and\\n•\\t risk databases that may be available from industry or proprietary sources.\\n11.4.1.6 organizational process assets\\ndescribed in section 2.1.4. the organizational process assets that can influence the perform quantitative risk \\nanalysis process include information from prior, similar completed projects.\\n11.4.2 perform quantitative risk analysis: tools and techniques\\n11.4.2.1 data gathering and representation techniques\\n•\\t interviewing. interviewing techniques draw on experience and historical data to quantify the probability \\nand impact of risks on project objectives. the information needed depends upon the type of probability \\ndistributions that will be used. for instance, information would be gathered on the optimistic (low), \\npessimistic (high), and most likely scenarios for some commonly used distributions. examples of three-\\npoint estimates for cost are shown in figure 11-13. additional information on three-point estimates \\nappears in estimate activity durations (section 6.5) and estimate costs (section 7.2). documenting the \\nrationale of the risk ranges and the assumptions behind them are important components of the risk \\ninterview because they can provide insight on the reliability and credibility of the analysis.\\n•\\t probability distributions. continuous probability distributions, which are used extensively in modeling \\nand simulation, represent the uncertainty in values such as durations of schedule activities and costs \\nof project components. discrete distributions can be used to represent uncertain events such as the \\noutcome of a test or a possible scenario in a decision tree. two examples of widely used continuous \\ndistributions are shown in figure 11-14. these distributions depict shapes that are compatible with the \\ndata typically developed during the quantitative risk analysis. uniform distributions can be used if there \\nis no obvious value that is more likely than any other between specified high and low bounds such as in \\nthe early concept stage of design.\\n11.4.2.2 quantitative risk analysis and modeling techniques\\ncommonly used techniques use both event-oriented and project-oriented analysis approaches include:\\n•\\t sensitivity analysis. sensitivity analysis helps to determine which risks have the most potential \\nimpact on the project. it helps to understand how the variations in project objectives correlate with \\nvariations in different uncertainties. conversely, it examines the extent to which the uncertainty of \\neach project element affects the objective being studied when all other uncertain elements are held at \\ntheir baseline values. one typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram (figure 11-15), \\nwhich is useful for comparing relative importance and impact of variables that have a high degree of \\nuncertainty to those that are more stable. the tornado diagram is also helpful in analyzing risk-taking \\nscenarios enabled on specific risks whose quantitative analysis highlights possible benefits greater \\nthan corresponding identified negative impacts. a tornado diagram is a special type of bar chart used \\nin sensitivity analysis for comparing the relative importance of the variables. in a tornado diagram, \\nthe y-axis contains each type of uncertainty at base values, and the x-axis contains the spread or \\ncorrelation of the uncertainty to the studied output. in this figure, each uncertainty contains a horizontal \\nbar and is ordered vertically to show uncertainties with a decreasing spread from the base values.\\n•\\t expected monetary value analysis. expected monetary value (emv) analysis is a statistical concept \\nthat calculates the average outcome when the future includes scenarios that may or may not happen \\n. the emv of opportunities are generally expressed as positive values, \\nwhile those of threats are expressed as negative values. emv requires a risk-neutral assumption—\\nneither risk averse nor risk seeking. emv for a project is calculated by multiplying the value of each \\npossible outcome by its probability of occurrence and adding the products together. a common use of \\nthis type of analysis is a decision tree analysis (figure 11-16).\\n•\\t modeling and simulation. a project simulation uses a model that translates the specified detailed \\nuncertainties of the project into their potential impact on project objectives. simulations are typically \\nperformed using the monte carlo technique. in a simulation, the project model is computed many times \\n(iterated), with the input values (such as cost estimates or activity durations) chosen at random for each \\niteration from the probability distributions of these variables. a histogram (such as total cost or completion \\ndate) is calculated from the iterations. for a cost risk analysis, a simulation uses cost estimates. for a \\nschedule risk analysis, the schedule network diagram and duration estimates are used. the output from a \\ncost risk simulation using the three-element model and risk ranges is shown in figure 11-17. it illustrates \\nthe respective probability of achieving specific cost targets. similar curves can be developed for other \\nproject objectives.\\n11.4.2.3 expert judgment\\nexpert judgment (ideally using experts with relevant, recent experience) is required to identify potential cost \\nand schedule impacts, to evaluate probability, and to define inputs such as probability distributions into the tools.\\nexpert judgment also comes into play in the interpretation of the data. experts should be able to identify the \\nweaknesses of the tools as well as their strengths. experts may determine when a specific tool may or may not be \\nmore appropriate given the organization capabilities and culture.\\n11.4.3 perform quantitative risk analysis: outputs\\n11.4.3.1 project documents updates\\nproject documents are updated with information resulting from quantitative risk analysis. for example, risk \\nregister updates could include:\\n•\\t probabilistic analysis of the project. estimates are made of potential project schedule and cost  \\noutcomes listing the possible completion dates and costs with their associated confidence levels. \\nthis output, often expressed as a cumulative frequency distribution, is used with stakeholder risk \\ntolerances to permit quantification of the cost and time contingency reserves. such contingency \\nreserves are needed to bring the risk of overrunning stated project objectives to a level acceptable to \\nthe organization.\\n•\\t probability of achieving cost and time objectives. with the risks facing the project, the probability \\nof achieving project objectives under the current plan can be estimated using quantitative risk analysis \\nresults. for instance, in figure 11-17, the likelihood of achieving the cost estimate of us$41 million is \\nabout 12%.\\n•\\t prioritized list of quantified risks. this list includes those risks that pose the greatest threat or present \\nthe greatest opportunity to the project. these include the risks that may have the greatest effect on cost \\ncontingency and those that are most likely to influence the critical path. these risks may be evaluated, in \\nsome cases, through a tornado diagram generated as a result of the simulation analysis.\\n•\\t trends in quantitative risk analysis results. as the analysis is repeated, a trend may is apparent \\nthat leads to conclusions affecting risk responses. organizational historical information on project schedule, \\ncost, quality, and performance should reflect new insights gained through the perform quantitative risk \\nanalysis process. such history may take the form of a quantitative risk analysis report. this report may \\nbe separate from, or linked to, the risk register.\\n',\n",
       " 'perform qualitative risk analysis is the process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action by assessing \\nand combining their probability of occurrence and impact. the key benefit of this process is that it enables project \\nmanagers to reduce the level of uncertainty and to focus on high-priority risks. the inputs, tools and techniques, \\nand outputs of this process are depicted in figure 11-8. figure 11-9 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\nperform qualitative risk analysis assesses the priority of identified risks using their relative probability or \\nlikelihood of occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur, as well as other \\nfactors such as the time frame for response and the organization risk tolerance associated with the project \\nconstraints of cost, schedule, scope, and quality. such assessments reflect the risk attitude of the project \\nteam and other stakeholders. effective assessment therefore requires explicit identification and management \\nof the risk approaches of key participants in the perform qualitative risk analysis process. where these risk \\napproaches introduce bias into the assessment of identified risks, attention should be paid to identifying bias \\nand correcting for it.\\nestablishing definitions of the levels of probability and impact can reduce the influence of bias. the time \\ncriticality of risk-related actions may magnify the importance of a risk. an evaluation of the quality of the \\navailable information on project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of the risk importance to the project.\\nperform qualitative risk analysis is usually a rapid and cost-effective means of establishing priorities for plan \\nrisk responses and lays the foundation for perform quantitative risk analysis, if required. the perform qualitative \\nrisk analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle, as defined in the project risk \\nmanagement plan. this process can lead into perform quantitative risk analysis (section 11.4) or directly into plan \\n\\nrisk responses (section 11.5).\\n11.3.1 perform qualitative risk analysis: inputs\\n11.3.1.1 risk management plan\\ndescribed in section 11.1.3.1. key elements of the risk management plan used in the perform qualitative risk \\nanalysis process include roles and responsibilities for conducting risk management, budgets, schedule activities \\nfor risk management, risk categories, definitions of probability and impact, the probability and impact matrix, \\nand revised stakeholders’ risk tolerances. these inputs are usually tailored to the project during the plan risk \\nmanagement process. if they are not available, they may be developed during the perform qualitative risk analysis \\nprocess.\\n11.3.1.2 scope baseline\\ndescribed in section 5.4.3.1. projects of a common or recurrent type tend to have more well-understood risks. \\nprojects using state-of-the-art or first-of-its-kind technology, and highly complex projects, tend to have more \\nuncertainty. this can be evaluated by examining the scope baseline.\\n11.3.1.3 risk register\\ndescribed in section 11.2.3.1. the risk register contains the information that will be used to assess and prioritize \\nrisks.\\n11.3.1.4 enterprise environmental factors\\ndescribed in section 2.1.5.entreprise_environmental_factors provide context_to_risk such as:\\n•\\t industry studies of similar projects by risk specialists, and\\n•\\t risk databases that may be available from

process include information on prior, similar completed projects.\\n11.3.2 perform qualitative risk analysis: tools and techniques\\n11.3.2.1 risk probability and impact assessment\\nrisk probability assessment investigates the likelihood that each specific risk will occur. risk impact \\nassessment investigates the potential effect on a project objective such as schedule, cost, quality, or performance, \\nincluding both negative effects for threats and positive effects for opportunities.\\nprobability and impact are assessed for each identified risk. risks can be assessed in interviews or meetings \\nwith participants selected for their familiarity with the risk categories on the agenda. project team members and \\nknowledgeable persons external to the project are included.\\nthe level of probability for each risk and its impact on each objective is evaluated during the interview or meeting. \\nexplanatory detail include assumptions justifying the levels assigned, are also recorded. risk probabilities \\nand impacts are rated according to the definitions given in the risk management plan. risks with low ratings of \\nprobability and impact will be included within the risk register as part of the watch list for future monitoring.\\n11.3.2.2 probability and impact matrix\\nrisks can be prioritized for further quantitative analysis and planning risk responses based on their risk rating. \\nratings are assigned to risks based on their assessed probability and impact. evaluation of each risk importance \\nand priority for attention is typically conducted using a look-up table or a probability and impact matrix. such a \\nmatrix specifies combinations of probability and impact that lead to rating the risks as low, moderate, or high \\npriority. descriptive terms or numeric values can be used depending on organizational preference.\\neach risk is rated on its probability of occurrence and impact on an objective if it does occur. the organization \\nshould determine which combinations of probability and impact result in a classification of high risk, moderate risk, \\nand low risk. in a black-and-white matrix, these conditions are denoted using different shades of gray. specifically \\nin figure 11-10, the dark gray area (with the largest numbers) represents high risk: the medium gray area (with \\nthe smallest numbers) represents low risk, and the light gray area (with in-between numbers) represents moderate \\nrisk. usually, these risk-rating rules are specified by the organization in advance of the project and included in \\norganizational process assets. risk rating rules can be tailored in the plan risk management process to the specific \\nproject.\\nas illustrated in figure 11-10, an organization can rate a risk separately for each objective (such as cost, time, \\nand scope). in addition, it may develop ways to determine one overall rating for each risk. finally, opportunities \\nand threats are handled in the same matrix using definitions of the different levels of impact that are appropriate \\nfor each.\\nthe risk score helps guide risk responses. for example, risks that have a negative impact on objectives, \\notherwise known as threats if they occur, and that are in the high-risk (dark gray) zone of the matrix, may require \\npriority action and aggressive response strategies. threats found in the low-risk (medium gray) zone may not \\nrequire proactive management action beyond being placed in the risk register as part of the watch list or adding \\na contingency reserve. similarly for opportunities, those in the high-risk (dark gray) zone, which may be obtained \\nmost easily and offer the greatest benefit, should be targeted first. opportunities in the low-risk (medium gray) zone \\nshould be monitored.\\n11.3.2.3 risk data quality assessment\\nrisk data quality assessment is a technique to evaluate the degree to which the data about risks is useful \\nfor risk management. it involves examining the degree to which the risk is understood and the accuracy, quality, \\nreliability, and integrity of the data about the risk.\\nthe use of low-quality risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis of little use to the project. if data quality is \\nunacceptable, it may be necessary to gather better data. often, the collection of information about risks is difficult, \\nand consumes more time and resources than originally planned. the values used in the example in figure 11-10 \\nare representative. the numbers of steps in the scale are usually established when defining the risk attitude of the \\norganization.\\n11.3.2.4 risk categorization\\nrisks to the project can be categorized by sources of risk (such as using the rbs), the area of the project affected \\n(such as using the wbs), or other useful categories (such as project phase) to determine the areas of the project most \\nexposed to the effects of uncertainty. risks can also be categorized by common root causes. this technique helps \\ndetermine work packages, activities, project phases or even roles in the project, which can lead to the development \\nof effective risk responses.\\n11.3.2.5 risk urgency assessment\\nrisks requiring near-term responses may be considered more urgent to address. indicators of priority may \\ninclude probability of detecting the risk, time to affect a risk response, symptoms and warning signs, and the \\nrisk rating. in some qualitative analyses, the assessment of risk urgency is combined with the risk ranking that is \\ndetermined from the probability and impact matrix to give a final risk severity rating.\\n11.3.2.6 expert judgment\\nexpert judgment is required to assess the probability and impact of each risk to determine its location in \\nthe matrix shown in figure 11-10. experts generally are those having experience with similar, recent projects. \\ngathering expert judgment is often accomplished with the use of risk facilitation workshops or interviews. the \\nexperts’ bias should be taken into account in this process.\\n11.3.3 perform qualitative risk analysis: outputs\\n\\n11.3.3.1 project documents updates\\nproject documents that may be updated include:\\n•\\t risk  register  updates.  as  new  information  is  available  through  the  qualitative  risk \\nassessment, the risk register is updated. updates to the risk register may include assessments \\nof probability and impacts for each risk, risk ranking or scores, risk urgency information or risk \\ncategorization, and a watch list for low probability risks or risks requiring further analysis.\\n•\\t assumptions log updates. as new information is available through the qualitative risk \\nassessment, assumptions could change. the assumptions log needs to be revisited to accommodate \\nthis new information. assumptions may be incorporated into the project scope statement or in a \\nseparate assumptions log.\\n',\n",
       " 'identify risks is the process of determining which risks may affect the project and documenting their \\ncharacteristics. the key benefit of this process is the documentation of existing

register\\ndescribed in section 13.1.3.1. information about the stakeholders is useful for soliciting inputs to identify risks, \\nas this will ensure that key stakeholders, especially the stakeholder, sponsor, and customer are interviewed or \\notherwise participate during the identify risks process.\\n11.2.1.10 project documents\\nproject documents provide the project team with information about decisions that help better identify project \\nrisks. project documents improve cross-team and stakeholder communications and include:\\n•\\t project charter,\\n•\\t project schedule,\\n•\\t schedule network diagrams,\\n•\\t issue log,\\n•\\t quality checklist, and\\n•\\t other information proven to be valuable in identifying risks.\\n11.2.1.11 procurement documents\\ndefined in section 12.1.3.3. if the project requires external procurement of resources, procurement \\ndocuments is a key input to the identify risks process. the complexity and the level of detail of the \\n\\nprocurement documents should be consistent with the value of, and risks associated with, planned procurement.\\n11.2.1.12 enterprise environmental factors\\ndescribed in section 2.1.5. enterprise environmental factors that can influence the identify risks process \\ninclude:\\n•\\t published information include commercial databases,\\n•\\t academic studies,\\n•\\t published checklists,\\n•\\t benchmarking,\\n•\\t industry studies, and\\n•\\t risk attitudes.\\n11.2.1.13 organizational process assets\\ndescribed in section 2.1.4. organizational process assets that can influence the identify risks process include:\\n•\\t project files include actual data,\\n•\\t organizational and project process controls,\\n•\\t risk statement formats or templates, and\\n•\\t lessons learned.\\n11.2.2 identify risks: tools and techniques\\n11.2.2.1 documentation reviews\\na structured review of the project documentation may be performed include plans, assumptions, previous \\nproject files, agreements, and other information. the quality of the plans, as well as consistency between those \\nplans and the project requirements and assumptions, may be indicators of risk in the project.\\n11.2.2.2 information gathering techniques\\nexamples of information gathering techniques used in identifying risks can include:\\n•\\t brainstorming. the goal of brainstorming is to obtain a comprehensive list of project risks. the project \\nteam usually performs brainstorming, often with a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the \\nteam. ideas about project risk are generated under the leadership of a facilitator, either in a traditional \\nfree-form brainstorm session or structured mass interviewing techniques. categories of risk such as in a \\nrisk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework. risks are then identified and categorized by type \\nof risk and their definitions are refined.\\n•\\t delphi technique. the delphi technique is a way to reach a consensus of experts. project risk experts \\nparticipate in this technique anonymously. a facilitator uses a questionnaire to solicit ideas about the \\nimportant project risks. the responses are summarized and are then recirculated to the experts for \\nfurther comment. consensus may be reached in a few rounds of this process. the delphi technique helps \\nreduce bias in the data and keeps any one person from having undue influence on the outcome.\\n•\\t interviewing. interviewing experienced project participants, stakeholders, and subject matter experts \\nhelps to identify risks.\\n•\\t root cause analysis. root-cause analysis is a specific technique used to identify a problem, discover \\nthe underlying causes that lead to it, and develop preventive action.\\n11.2.2.3 checklist analysis\\nrisk identification checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been \\naccumulated from previous similar projects and from other sources of information. the lowest level of the rbs \\ncan also be used as a risk checklist. while a checklist may be quick and simple, it is impossible to build an \\nexhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid the effort of proper risk \\nidentification. the team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist. additionally, the checklist \\nshould be pruned from time to time to remove or archive related items. the checklist should be reviewed during \\nproject closure to incorporate new lessons learned and improve it for use on future projects.\\n11.2.2.4 assumptions analysis\\n\\nevery project and its plan is conceived and developed based on a set of hypotheses, scenarios, or assumptions. \\nassumptions analysis explores the validity of assumptions as they apply to the project. it identifies risks to the \\nproject from inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions.\\n11.2.2.5 diagramming techniques\\nrisk diagramming techniques may include:\\n•\\t cause and effect diagrams. these are also known as ishikawa or fishbone diagrams and are useful for \\nidentifying causes of risks.\\n•\\t system or process flow charts. these show how various elements of a system interrelate and the \\nmechanism of causation.\\n•\\t influence diagrams. these are graphical representations of situations showing causal influences, time \\nordering of events, and other relationships among variables and outcomes, as shown in figure 11-7.\\n11.2.2.6 swot analysis\\nthis technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (swot) \\nperspectives to increase the breadth of identified risks by including internally generated risks. the technique starts \\nwith identification of strengths and weaknesses of the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, \\nor the business area in general. swot analysis then identifies any opportunities for the project that arise from \\norganizational strengths, and any threats arising from organizational weaknesses. the analysis also examines \\nthe degree to which organizational strengths offset threats, as well as identifying opportunities that may serve to \\novercome weaknesses.\\n11.2.2.7 expert judgment\\nrisks may be identified directly by experts with relevant experience with similar projects or business areas. \\nsuch experts should be identified by the project manager and invited to consider all aspects of the project and \\nsuggest possible risks based on their previous experience and areas of expertise. the experts’ bias should be taken \\ninto account in this process.\\n11.2.3 identify risks: outputs\\n11.2.3.1 risk register\\nthe primary output from identify risks is the initial entry into the risk register. the risk register is a document \\nin which the results of risk analysis and risk response planning are recorded. it contains the outcomes of the other \\nrisk management processes as they are conducted, resulting in an increase in the level and type of information \\ncontained in the risk register over time. the preparation of the risk register begins in the identify risks process \\n\\nwith the following information, and then is available to other project management and risk management \\nprocesses.risk_register include:\\n•\\t list of identified risks. the identified risks are described in as much detail as is reasonable. a \\nstructure for describing risks using risk statements may be applied, for example, event may occur \\ncausing impact, or if cause exists, event may occur leading to effect. in addition to the list of \\nidentified risks, the root causes of those risks may is more evident. these are the fundamental \\nconditions or events that may give rise to one or more identified risks. they should be recorded and \\nused to support future risk identification for this and other projects.\\n•\\t list of potential responses. potential responses to a risk may sometimes be identified during the identify \\nrisks process. these responses, if identified in this process, should be used as inputs to the plan risk \\nresponses process.\\n',\n",

academic studies,\\n•\\t published checklists,\\n•\\t benchmarking,\\n•\\t industry studies, and\\n•\\t risk attitudes.\\n11.2.1.13 organizational process assets\\ndescribed in section 2.1.4. organizational process assets that can influence the identify risks process include:\\n•\\t project files include actual data,\\n•\\t organizational and project process controls,\\n•\\t risk statement formats or templates, and\\n•\\t lessons learned.\\n11.2.2 identify risks: tools and techniques\\n11.2.2.1 documentation reviews\\na structured review of the project documentation may be performed include plans, assumptions, previous \\nproject files, agreements, and other information. the quality of the plans, as well as consistency between those \\nplans and the project requirements and assumptions, may be indicators of risk in the project.\\n11.2.2.2 information gathering techniques\\nexamples of information gathering techniques used in identifying risks can include:\\n•\\t brainstorming. the goal of brainstorming is to obtain a comprehensive list of project risks. the project \\nteam usually performs brainstorming, often with a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the \\nteam. ideas about project risk are generated under the leadership of a facilitator, either in a traditional \\nfree-form brainstorm session or structured mass interviewing techniques. categories of risk such as in a \\nrisk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework. risks are then identified and categorized by type \\nof risk and their definitions are refined.\\n•\\t delphi technique. the delphi technique is a way to reach a consensus of experts. project risk experts \\nparticipate in this technique anonymously. a facilitator uses a questionnaire to solicit ideas about the \\nimportant project risks. the responses are summarized and are then recirculated to the experts for \\nfurther comment. consensus may be reached in a few rounds of this process. the delphi technique helps \\nreduce bias in the data and keeps any one person from having undue influence on the outcome.\\n•\\t interviewing. interviewing experienced project participants, stakeholders, and subject matter experts \\nhelps to identify risks.\\n•\\t root cause analysis. root-cause analysis is a specific technique used to identify a problem, discover \\nthe underlying causes that lead to it, and develop preventive action.\\n11.2.2.3 checklist analysis\\nrisk identification checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been \\naccumulated from previous similar projects and from other sources of information. the lowest level of the rbs \\ncan also be used as a risk checklist. while a checklist may be quick and simple, it is impossible to build an \\nexhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid the effort of proper risk \\nidentification. the team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist. additionally, the checklist \\nshould be pruned from time to time to remove or archive related items. the checklist should be reviewed during \\nproject closure to incorporate new lessons learned and improve it for use on future projects.\\n11.2.2.4 assumptions analysis\\n\\nevery project and its plan is conceived and developed based on a set of hypotheses, scenarios, or assumptions. \\nassumptions analysis explores the validity of assumptions as they apply to the project. it identifies risks to the \\nproject from inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions.\\n11.2.2.5 diagramming techniques\\nrisk diagramming techniques may include:\\n•\\t cause and effect diagrams. these are also known as ishikawa or fishbone diagrams and are useful for \\nidentifying causes of risks.\\n•\\t system or process flow charts. these show how various elements of a system interrelate and the \\nmechanism of causation.\\n•\\t influence diagrams. these are graphical representations of situations showing causal influences, time \\nordering of events, and other relationships among variables and outcomes, as shown in figure 11-7.\\n11.2.2.6 swot analysis\\nthis technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (swot) \\nperspectives to increase the breadth of identified risks by including internally generated risks. the technique starts \\nwith identification of strengths and weaknesses of the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, \\nor the business area in general. swot analysis then identifies any opportunities for the project that arise from \\norganizational strengths, and any threats arising from organizational weaknesses. the analysis also examines \\nthe degree to which organizational strengths offset threats, as well as identifying opportunities that may serve to \\novercome weaknesses.\\n11.2.2.7 expert judgment\\nrisks may be identified directly by experts with relevant experience with similar projects or business areas. \\nsuch experts should be identified by the project manager and invited to consider all aspects of the project and \\nsuggest possible risks based on their previous experience and areas of expertise. the experts’ bias should be taken \\ninto account in this process.\\n11.2.3 identify risks: outputs\\n11.2.3.1 risk register\\nthe primary output from identify risks is the initial entry into the risk register. the risk register is a document \\nin which the results of risk analysis and risk response planning are recorded. it contains the outcomes of the other \\nrisk management processes as they are conducted, resulting in an increase in the level and type of information \\ncontained in the risk register over time. the preparation of the risk register begins in the identify risks process \\n\\nwith the following information, and then is available to other project management and risk management \\nprocesses.risk_register include:\\n•\\t list of identified risks. the identified risks are described in as much detail as is reasonable. a \\nstructure for describing risks using risk statements may be applied, for example, event may occur \\ncausing impact, or if cause exists, event may occur leading to effect. in addition to the list of \\nidentified risks, the root causes of those risks may is more evident. these are the fundamental \\nconditions or events that may give rise to one or more identified risks. they should be recorded and \\nused to support future risk identification for this and other projects.\\n•\\t list of potential responses. potential responses to a risk may sometimes be identified during the identify \\nrisks process. these responses, if identified in this process, should be used as inputs to the plan risk \\nresponses process.\\n',\n",
       " 'perform qualitative risk analysis': 'perform qualitative risk analysis is the process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action by assessing \\nand combining their probability of occurrence and impact. the key benefit of this process is that it enables project \\nmanagers to reduce the level of uncertainty and to focus on high-priority risks. the inputs, tools and techniques, \\nand outputs of this process are depicted in figure 11-8. figure 11-9 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\nperform qualitative risk analysis assesses the priority of identified risks using their relative probability or \\nlikelihood of occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur, as well as other \\nfactors such as the time frame for response and the organization risk tolerance associated with the project \\nconstraints of cost, schedule, scope, and quality. such assessments reflect the risk attitude of the project \\nteam and other stakeholders. effective assessment therefore requires explicit identification and management \\nof the risk approaches of key participants in the perform qualitative risk analysis process. where these risk \\napproaches introduce bias into the assessment of identified risks, attention should be paid to identifying bias \\nand correcting for it.\\nestablishing definitions of the levels of probability and impact can reduce the influence of bias. the time \\ncriticality of risk-related actions may magnify the importance of a risk. an evaluation of the quality of the \\navailable information on project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of the risk importance to the project.\\nperform qualitative risk analysis is usually a rapid and cost-effective means of establishing priorities for plan \\nrisk responses and lays the foundation for perform quantitative risk analysis, if required. the perform qualitative \\nrisk analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle, as defined in the project risk \\nmanagement plan. this process can lead into perform quantitative risk analysis (section 11.4) or directly into plan \\n\\nrisk responses (section 11.5).\\n11.3.1 perform qualitative risk analysis: inputs\\n11.3.1.1 risk management plan\\ndescribed in section 11.1.3.1. key elements of the risk management plan used in the perform qualitative risk \\nanalysis process include roles and responsibilities for conducting risk management, budgets, schedule activities \\nfor risk management, risk categories, definitions of probability and impact, the probability and impact matrix, \\nand revised stakeholders’ risk tolerances. these inputs are usually tailored to the project during the plan risk \\nmanagement process. if they are not available, they may be developed during the perform qualitative risk analysis \\nprocess.\\n11.3.1.2 scope baseline\\ndescribed in section 5.4.3.1. projects of a common or recurrent type tend to have more well-understood risks. \\nprojects using state-of-the-art or first-of-its-kind technology, and highly complex projects, tend to have more \\nuncertainty. this can be evaluated by examining the scope baseline.\\n11.3.1.3 risk register\\ndescribed in section 11.2.3.1. the risk register contains the information that will be used to assess and prioritize \\nrisks.\\n11.3.1.4 enterprise

perform qualitative risk \\nanalysis process include information on prior, similar completed projects.\\n11.3.2 perform qualitative risk analysis: tools and techniques\\n11.3.2.1 risk probability and impact assessment\\nrisk probability assessment investigates the likelihood that each specific risk will occur. risk impact \\nassessment investigates the potential effect on a project objective such as schedule, cost, quality, or performance, \\nincluding both negative effects for threats and positive effects for opportunities.\\nprobability and impact are assessed for each identified risk. risks can be assessed in interviews or meetings \\nwith participants selected for their familiarity with the risk categories on the agenda. project team members and \\nknowledgeable persons external to the project are included.\\nthe level of probability for each risk and its impact on each objective is evaluated during the interview or meeting. \\nexplanatory detail include assumptions justifying the levels assigned, are also recorded. risk probabilities \\nand impacts are rated according to the definitions given in the risk management plan. risks with low ratings of \\nprobability and impact will be included within the risk register as part of the watch list for future monitoring.\\n11.3.2.2 probability and impact matrix\\nrisks can be prioritized for further quantitative analysis and planning risk responses based on their risk rating. \\nratings are assigned to risks based on their assessed probability and impact. evaluation of each risk importance \\nand priority for attention is typically conducted using a look-up table or a probability and impact matrix. such a \\nmatrix specifies combinations of probability and impact that lead to rating the risks as low, moderate, or high \\npriority. descriptive terms or numeric values can be used depending on organizational preference.\\neach risk is rated on its probability of occurrence and impact on an objective if it does occur. the organization \\nshould determine which combinations of probability and impact result in a classification of high risk, moderate risk, \\nand low risk. in a black-and-white matrix, these conditions are denoted using different shades of gray. specifically \\nin figure 11-10, the dark gray area (with the largest numbers) represents high risk: the medium gray area (with \\nthe smallest numbers) represents low risk, and the light gray area (with in-between numbers) represents moderate \\nrisk. usually, these risk-rating rules are specified by the organization in advance of the project and included in \\norganizational process assets. risk rating rules can be tailored in the plan risk management process to the specific \\nproject.\\nas illustrated in figure 11-10, an organization can rate a risk separately for each objective (such as cost, time, \\nand scope). in addition, it may develop ways to determine one overall rating for each risk. finally, opportunities \\nand threats are handled in the same matrix using definitions of the different levels of impact that are appropriate \\nfor each.\\nthe risk score helps guide risk responses. for example, risks that have a negative impact on objectives, \\notherwise known as threats if they occur, and that are in the high-risk (dark gray) zone of the matrix, may require \\npriority action and aggressive response strategies. threats found in the low-risk (medium gray) zone may not \\nrequire proactive management action beyond being placed in the risk register as part of the watch list or adding \\na contingency reserve. similarly for opportunities, those in the high-risk (dark gray) zone, which may be obtained \\nmost easily and offer the greatest benefit, should be targeted first. opportunities in the low-risk (medium gray) zone \\nshould be monitored.\\n11.3.2.3 risk data quality assessment\\nrisk data quality assessment is a technique to evaluate the degree to which the data about risks is useful \\nfor risk management. it involves examining the degree to which the risk is understood and the accuracy, quality, \\nreliability, and integrity of the data about the risk.\\nthe use of low-quality risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis of little use to the project. if data quality is \\nunacceptable, it may be necessary to gather better data. often, the collection of information about risks is difficult, \\nand consumes more time and resources than originally planned. the values used in the example in figure 11-10 \\nare representative. the numbers of steps in the scale are usually established when defining the risk attitude of the \\norganization.\\n11.3.2.4 risk categorization\\nrisks to the project can be categorized by sources of risk (such as using the rbs), the area of the project affected \\n(such as using the wbs), or other useful categories (such as project phase) to determine the areas of the project most \\nexposed to the effects of uncertainty. risks can also be categorized by common root causes. this technique helps \\ndetermine work packages, activities, project phases or even roles in the project, which can lead to the development \\nof effective risk responses.\\n11.3.2.5 risk urgency assessment\\nrisks requiring near-term responses may be considered more urgent to address. indicators of priority may \\ninclude probability of detecting the risk, time to affect a risk response, symptoms and warning signs, and the \\nrisk rating. in some qualitative analyses, the assessment of risk urgency is combined with the risk ranking that is \\ndetermined from the probability and impact matrix to give a final risk severity rating.\\n11.3.2.6 expert judgment\\nexpert judgment is required to assess the probability and impact of each risk to determine its location in \\nthe matrix shown in figure 11-10. experts generally are those having experience with similar, recent projects. \\ngathering expert judgment is often accomplished with the use of risk facilitation workshops or interviews. the \\nexperts’ bias should be taken into account in this process.\\n11.3.3 perform qualitative risk analysis: outputs\\n\\n11.3.3.1 project documents updates\\nproject documents that may be updated include:\\n•\\t risk  register  updates.  as  new  information  is  available  through  the  qualitative  risk \\nassessment, the risk register is updated. updates to the risk register may include assessments \\nof probability and impacts for each risk, risk ranking or scores, risk urgency information or risk \\ncategorization, and a watch list for low probability risks or risks requiring further analysis.\\n•\\t assumptions log updates. as new information is available through the qualitative risk \\nassessment, assumptions could change. the assumptions log needs to be revisited to accommodate \\nthis new information. assumptions may be incorporated into the project scope statement or in a \\nseparate assumptions log.\\n',\n",
       " 'perform quantitative risk analysis': 'perform quantitative risk analysis is the process of numerically analyzing the effect of identified risks on overall \\nproject objectives. the key benefit of this process is that it produces quantitative risk information to support decision \\nmaking in order to reduce project uncertainty. the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are \\ndepicted in figure 11-11. figure 11-12 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\nperform quantitative risk analysis is performed on risks that have been prioritized by the perform qualitative \\nrisk analysis process as potentially and substantially impacting the project competing demands. the perform \\nquantitative risk analysis process analyzes the effect of those risks on project objectives. it is used mostly to \\nevaluate the aggregate effect of all risks affecting the project. when the risks drive the quantitative analysis, the \\nprocess may be used to assign a numerical priority rating to those risks individually.\\nperform quantitative risk analysis generally follows the perform qualitative risk analysis process. in some \\ncases, it may not be possible to execute the perform quantitative risk analysis process due to lack of sufficient \\ndata to develop appropriate models. the project manager should exercise expert judgment to determine the need \\nfor and the viability of quantitative risk analysis. the availability of time and budget, and the need for qualitative or \\nquantitative statements about risk and impacts, will determine which method(s) to use on any particular project. \\nperform quantitative risk analysis should be repeated, as needed, as part of the control risks process to determine \\nif the overall project risk has been satisfactorily decreased. trends may indicate the need for more or less focus on \\nappropriate risk management activities.\\n11.4.1 perform quantitative risk analysis: inputs\\n11.4.1.1 risk

risk analysis: tools and techniques\\n11.4.2.1 data gathering and representation techniques\\n•\\t interviewing. interviewing techniques draw on experience and historical data to quantify the probability \\nand impact of risks on project objectives. the information needed depends upon the type of probability \\ndistributions that will be used. for instance, information would be gathered on the optimistic (low), \\npessimistic (high), and most likely scenarios for some commonly used distributions. examples of three-\\npoint estimates for cost are shown in figure 11-13. additional information on three-point estimates \\nappears in estimate activity durations (section 6.5) and estimate costs (section 7.2). documenting the \\nrationale of the risk ranges and the assumptions behind them are important components of the risk \\ninterview because they can provide insight on the reliability and credibility of the analysis.\\n•\\t probability distributions. continuous probability distributions, which are used extensively in modeling \\nand simulation, represent the uncertainty in values such as durations of schedule activities and costs \\nof project components. discrete distributions can be used to represent uncertain events such as the \\noutcome of a test or a possible scenario in a decision tree. two examples of widely used continuous \\ndistributions are shown in figure 11-14. these distributions depict shapes that are compatible with the \\ndata typically developed during the quantitative risk analysis. uniform distributions can be used if there \\nis no obvious value that is more likely than any other between specified high and low bounds such as in \\nthe early concept stage of design.\\n11.4.2.2 quantitative risk analysis and modeling techniques\\ncommonly used techniques use both event-oriented and project-oriented analysis approaches include:\\n•\\t sensitivity analysis. sensitivity analysis helps to determine which risks have the most potential \\nimpact on the project. it helps to understand how the variations in project objectives correlate with \\nvariations in different uncertainties. conversely, it examines the extent to which the uncertainty of \\neach project element affects the objective being studied when all other uncertain elements are held at \\ntheir baseline values. one typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram (figure 11-15), \\nwhich is useful for comparing relative importance and impact of variables that have a high degree of \\nuncertainty to those that are more stable. the tornado diagram is also helpful in analyzing risk-taking \\nscenarios enabled on specific risks whose quantitative analysis highlights possible benefits greater \\nthan corresponding identified negative impacts. a tornado diagram is a special type of bar chart used \\nin sensitivity analysis for comparing the relative importance of the variables. in a tornado diagram, \\nthe y-axis contains each type of uncertainty at base values, and the x-axis contains the spread or \\ncorrelation of the uncertainty to the studied output. in this figure, each uncertainty contains a horizontal \\nbar and is ordered vertically to show uncertainties with a decreasing spread from the base values.\\n•\\t expected monetary value analysis. expected monetary value (emv) analysis is a statistical concept \\nthat calculates the average outcome when the future includes scenarios that may or may not happen \\n. the emv of opportunities are generally expressed as positive values, \\nwhile those of threats are expressed as negative values. emv requires a risk-neutral assumption—\\nneither risk averse nor risk seeking. emv for a project is calculated by multiplying the value of each \\npossible outcome by its probability of occurrence and adding the products together. a common use of \\nthis type of analysis is a decision tree analysis (figure 11-16).\\n•\\t modeling and simulation. a project simulation uses a model that translates the specified detailed \\nuncertainties of the project into their potential impact on project objectives. simulations are typically \\nperformed using the monte carlo technique. in a simulation, the project model is computed many times \\n(iterated), with the input values (such as cost estimates or activity durations) chosen at random for each \\niteration from the probability distributions of these variables. a histogram (such as total cost or completion \\ndate) is calculated from the iterations. for a cost risk analysis, a simulation uses cost estimates. for a \\nschedule risk analysis, the schedule network diagram and duration estimates are used. the output from a \\ncost risk simulation using the three-element model and risk ranges is shown in figure 11-17. it illustrates \\nthe respective probability of achieving specific cost targets. similar curves can be developed for other \\nproject objectives.\\n11.4.2.3 expert judgment\\nexpert judgment (ideally using experts with relevant, recent experience) is required to identify potential cost \\nand schedule impacts, to evaluate probability, and to define inputs such as probability distributions into the tools.\\nexpert judgment also comes into play in the interpretation of the data. experts should be able to identify the \\nweaknesses of the tools as well as their strengths. experts may determine when a specific tool may or may not be \\nmore appropriate given the organization capabilities and culture.\\n11.4.3 perform quantitative risk analysis: outputs\\n11.4.3.1 project documents updates\\nproject documents are updated with information resulting from quantitative risk analysis. for example, risk \\nregister updates could include:\\n•\\t probabilistic analysis of the project. estimates are made of potential project schedule and cost  \\noutcomes listing the possible completion dates and costs with their associated confidence levels. \\nthis output, often expressed as a cumulative frequency distribution, is used with stakeholder risk \\ntolerances to permit quantification of the cost and time contingency reserves. such contingency \\nreserves are needed to bring the risk of overrunning stated project objectives to a level acceptable to \\nthe organization.\\n•\\t probability of achieving cost and time objectives. with the risks facing the project, the probability \\nof achieving project objectives under the current plan can be estimated using quantitative risk analysis \\nresults. for instance, in figure 11-17, the likelihood of achieving the cost estimate of us$41 million is \\nabout 12%.\\n•\\t prioritized list of quantified risks. this list includes those risks that pose the greatest threat or present \\nthe greatest opportunity to the project. these include the risks that may have the greatest effect on cost \\ncontingency and those that are most likely to influence the critical path. these risks may be evaluated, in \\nsome cases, through a tornado diagram generated as a result of the simulation analysis.\\n•\\t trends in quantitative risk analysis results. as the analysis is repeated, a trend may is apparent \\nthat leads to conclusions affecting risk responses. organizational historical information on project schedule, \\ncost, quality, and performance should reflect new insights gained through the perform quantitative risk \\nanalysis process. such history may take the form of a quantitative risk analysis report. this report may \\nbe separate from, or linked to, the risk register.\\n',\n",
       " 'plan risk responses': 'plan risk responses is the process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and to reduce \\nthreats to project objectives. the key benefit of this process is that it addresses the risks by their priority, inserting \\nresources and activities into the budget, schedule and project management plan as needed. the inputs, tools and \\ntechniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in figure 11-18. figure 11-19 depicts the data flow diagram \\nof the process.\\nthe plan risk responses process follows the perform quantitative risk analysis process (if used). each risk \\nresponse requires an understanding of the mechanism by which it will address the risk. this is the mechanism \\nused to analyze if the risk response plan is having the desired effect. it includes the identification and assignment \\nof one person (an owner for risk response) to take responsibility for each agreed-to and funded risk response. risk \\nresponses should be appropriate for the significance of the risk, cost-effective in meeting the challenge, realistic \\nwithin the project context, agreed upon by all parties involved, and owned by a responsible person. selecting the \\noptimum risk response from several options is often required.\\nthe plan risk responses process presents commonly used approaches to planning responses to the risks. \\nrisks include threats and opportunities that can affect project success, and responses are discussed for each.\\n11.5.1 plan risk responses: inputs\\n11.5.1.1 risk management plan\\nimportant components of the risk management plan include roles and responsibilities, risk analysis definitions, \\n\\ntiming for reviews (and for eliminating risks from review), and risk thresholds for low, moderate, and high risks. risk \\nthresholds help identify those risks for which specific responses are needed.\\n11.5.1.2 risk register\\nthe risk register refers to identified risks, root causes of risks, lists of potential responses, risk owners, symptoms \\nand warning signs, the relative rating or priority list of project risks, risks requiring responses in the near term, risks \\nfor additional analysis and response, trends in qualitative analysis results, and a watch list, which is a list of low-\\npriority risks within the risk register.\\n11.5.2 plan risk responses: tools and techniques\\nseveral risk response strategies are available. the strategy or mix of strategies most likely to be effective \\nshould be selected for each risk. risk analysis tools such as decision tree analysis (section 11.4.2.2), can be \\nused to choose the most appropriate responses. specific actions are developed to implement that strategy, \\nincluding primary and backup strategies, as necessary. a fallback plan can be developed for implementation \\nif the selected strategy turns out not to be fully effective or if an accepted risk occurs. secondary risks should \\nalso be reviewed. secondary risks are risks that arise as a direct result of implementing a risk response. a \\ncontingency reserve is often allocated for time or cost. if developed, it may include identification of the conditions \\nthat trigger its use.\\n11.5.2.1 strategies for negative risks or threats\\nthree strategies, which typically deal with threats or risks that may have negative impacts on project objectives \\nif they occur, are: avoid, transfer, and mitigate. the fourth strategy, accept, can be used for negative risks or threats \\nas well as positive risks or opportunities. each of these risk response strategies have varied and unique influence \\non the risk condition. these strategies should be chosen to match the risk probability and impact on the project \\noverall objectives. avoidance and mitigation strategies are usually good strategies for critical risks with high impact, \\nwhile transference and acceptance are usually good strategies for threats that are less critical and with low overall \\nimpact. strategies_for_negative_risks_or_threats include:\\n•\\t avoid. risk avoidance is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to eliminate the threat or \\nprotect the project from its impact. it usually involves changing the project management plan to eliminate \\nthe threat entirely. the project manager may also isolate the project objectives from the risk impact or \\nchange the objective that is in jeopardy. examples of this include extending the schedule, changing the \\nstrategy, or reducing scope. the most radical avoidance strategy is to shut down the project entirely. \\nsome risks that arise early in the project can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, \\nimproving communication, or acquiring expertise.\\n•\\t transfer. risk transference is a risk response strategy whereby the project team shifts the impact of \\na threat to a third party, together with ownership of the response. transferring the risk simply gives \\nanother party responsibility for its management—it does not eliminate it. transferring does not mean \\ndisowning the risk by transferring it to a later project or another person without his or her knowledge or \\nagreement. risk transference nearly always involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on \\nthe risk. transferring liability for risk is most effective in dealing with financial risk exposure. transference \\ntools can be quite diverse and include the use of insurance, performance bonds, \\nwarranties, guarantees, etc. contracts or agreements may be used to transfer liability for specified risks \\nto another party. for example, when a buyer has capabilities that the seller does not possess, it may be \\nprudent to transfer some work and its concurrent risk contractually back to the buyer. in many cases, use \\nof a cost-plus contract may transfer the cost risk to the buyer, while a fixed-price contract may transfer \\nrisk to the seller.\\n•\\t mitigate. risk mitigation is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to reduce the \\nprobability of occurrence or impact of a risk. it implies a reduction in the probability and/or impact of an \\nadverse risk to be within acceptable threshold limits. taking early action to reduce the probability and/or \\nimpact of a risk occurring on the project is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the \\nrisk has occurred. adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable \\nsupplier are examples of mitigation actions. mitigation may require prototype development to reduce the \\nrisk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product. where it is not possible to reduce \\nprobability, a mitigation response might address the risk impact by targeting linkages that determine the \\nseverity. for example, designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the \\noriginal component.\\n•\\t accept. risk acceptance is a risk response strategy whereby the project team decides to acknowledge \\nthe risk and not take any action unless the risk occurs. this strategy is adopted where it is not possible \\nor cost-effective to address a specific risk in any other way. this strategy indicates that the project \\nteam has decided not to change the project management plan to deal with a risk, or is unable to identify \\nany other suitable response strategy. this strategy can be either passive or active. passive acceptance \\nrequires no action except to document the strategy, leaving the project team to deal with the risks as \\n\\nthey occur, and to periodically review the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly. the \\nmost common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve include amounts of \\ntime, money, or resources to handle the risks.\\n11.5.2.2 strategies for positive risks or opportunities\\nthree of the four responses are suggested to deal with risks with potentially positive impacts on project objectives. \\nthe fourth strategy, accept, can be used for negative risks or threats as well as positive risks or opportunities. strategies_for_positive_risks_or_opportunities include:\\n•\\t exploit. the exploit strategy may be selected for risks with positive impacts where the organization wishes \\nto ensure that the opportunity is realized. this strategy seeks to eliminate the uncertainty associated with \\na particular upside risk by ensuring the opportunity definitely happens. examples of directly exploiting \\nresponses include assigning an organization most talented resources to the project to reduce the time \\nto completion or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration required to \\nrealize project objectives.\\n•\\t enhance. the enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or the positive impacts of an \\nopportunity. identifying and maximizing key drivers of these positive-impact risks may increase the \\nprobability of their occurrence. examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to \\nan activity to finish early.\\n•\\t share. sharing a positive risk involves allocating some or all of the ownership of the opportunity to a \\nthird party who is best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project. examples of sharing \\nactions include forming risk-sharing partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures, \\nwhich can be established with the express purpose of taking advantage of the opportunity so that all \\nparties gain from their actions.\\n•\\t accept. accepting an opportunity is being willing to take advantage of the opportunity if it arises, but \\nnot actively pursuing it.\\n11.5.2.3 contingent response strategies\\nsome responses are designed for use only if certain events occur. for some risks, it is appropriate for \\nthe project team to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predefined conditions, if \\nit is believed that there will be sufficient warning to implement the plan. events that trigger the contingency \\nresponse such as missing intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with a supplier, should be defined \\nand tracked. risk responses identified using this technique are often called contingency plans or fallback plans \\nand include identified triggering events that set the plans in effect.\\n11.5.2.4 expert judgment\\nexpert judgment is input from knowledgeable parties pertaining to the actions to be taken on a specific and \\ndefined risk. expertise may be provided by any group or person with specialized education, knowledge, skill, \\nexperience, or training in establishing risk responses.\\n11.5.3 plan risk responses: outputs\\n11.5.3.1 project management plan updates\\nelements of the project management plan that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include:\\n•\\t schedule management plan. the schedule management plan is updated to reflect changes in process \\nand practice driven by the risk responses. this may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to \\nresource loading and leveling, as well as updates to the schedule strategy.\\n•\\t cost management plan. the cost management plan is updated to reflect changes in process and \\npractice driven by the risk responses. this may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to \\ncost accounting, tracking, and reports, as well as updates to the budget strategy and how contingency \\nreserves are consumed.\\n•\\t quality management plan. the quality management plan is updated to reflect changes in process \\nand practice driven by the risk responses. this may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to \\nrequirements, quality assurance, or quality control, as well as updates to the requirements documentation.\\n•\\t procurement management plan. the procurement management plan may be updated to reflect \\nchanges in strategy such as alterations in the make-or-buy decision or contract type(s) driven by the risk \\nresponses.\\n•\\t human resource management plan. the staffing management plan, part of the human resource \\nmanagement plan, is updated to reflect changes in project organizational structure and resource \\n\\napplications driven by the risk responses. this may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to \\nstaff allocation, as well as updates to the resource loading.\\n•\\t scope baseline. because of new, modified or omitted work generated by the risk responses, the scope \\nbaseline may be updated to reflect those changes.\\n•\\t schedule baseline. because of new work (or omitted work) generated by the risk responses, the schedule \\nbaseline may be updated to reflect those changes.\\n•\\t cost baseline. because of new work (or omitted work) generated by the risk responses, the cost baseline \\nmay be updated to reflect those changes.\\n11.5.3.2 project documents updates\\nin the plan risk responses process, several project documents are updated as needed. for example, when \\nappropriate risk responses are chosen and agreed upon, they are included in the risk register. the risk register \\nshould be written to a level of detail that corresponds with the priority ranking and the planned response. often, the \\nhigh and moderate risks are addressed in detail. risks judged to be of low priority are included in a watch list for \\nperiodic monitoring. updates to the risk register can include:\\n•\\t risk owners and assigned responsibilities;\\n•\\t agreed-upon response strategies;\\n•\\t specific actions to implement the chosen response strategy;\\n•\\t trigger conditions, symptoms, and warning signs of a risk occurrence;\\n•\\t budget and schedule activities required to implement the chosen responses;\\n•\\t contingency plans and triggers that call for their execution;\\n•\\t fallback plans for use as a reaction to a risk that has occurred and the primary response proves to be \\ninadequate;\\n•\\t residual risks that are expected to remain after planned responses have been taken, as well as those that \\nhave been deliberately accepted;\\n•\\t secondary risks that arise as a direct outcome of implementing a risk response; and\\n•\\t contingency reserves that are calculated based on the quantitative risk analysis of the project and the \\norganization risk thresholds.\\nother project documents updated could include:\\n•\\t assumptions log updates. as new information is available through the application of risk \\nresponses, assumptions could change. the assumptions log needs to be revisited to accommodate this \\nnew information.\\n•\\t technical documentation updates. as new information is available through the application \\nof risk responses, technical approaches and physical deliverables may change. any supporting \\ndocumentation needs to be revisited to accommodate this new information.\\n•\\t change requests. planning for possible risk responses can often result in recommendations for changes \\nto the resources, activities, cost estimates, and other items identified during other planning processes. \\nwhen such recommendations are identified, change requests are generated and processed through the \\nperform integrated change control process.\\n',\n",
       " 'control risks': 'control risks is the process of implementing risk response plans, tracking identified risks, monitoring residual \\nrisks, identifying new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project. the key benefit of \\nthis process is that it improves efficiency of the risk approach throughout the project life cycle to continuously \\noptimize risk responses. the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in figure 11-20. \\nfigure 11-21 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\nplanned risk responses that are included in the risk register are executed during the life cycle of the project, but \\nthe project work should be continuously monitored for new, changing, and outdated risks.\\nthe control risks process applies techniques such as variance and trend analysis, which require the use of \\nperformance information generated during project execution. other purposes of the control risks process are to \\ndetermine if:\\n•\\t project assumptions are still valid,\\n•\\t analysis shows an assessed risk has changed or can be retired,\\n•\\t risk management policies and procedures are being followed, and\\n•\\t contingency reserves for cost or schedule should be modified in alignment with the current risk \\nassessment.\\ncontrol risks can involve choosing alternative strategies, executing a contingency or fallback plan, taking \\ncorrective action, and modifying the project management plan. the risk response owner reports periodically to the \\nproject manager on the effectiveness of the plan, any unanticipated effects, and any correction needed to handle \\nthe risk appropriately. control risks also includes updating the organizational process assets include project \\nlessons learned databases and risk management templates, for the benefit of future projects.\\n11.6.1 control risks: inputs\\n11.6.1.1 project management plan\\ndescribed in section 4.2.3.1. the project management plan, which includes the risk management plan, provides \\nguidance for risk monitoring and controlling.\\n11.6.1.2 risk register\\nthe risk register has key inputs that include identified risks and risk owners, agreed-upon risk responses, \\ncontrol actions for assessing the effectiveness of response plans, risk responses, specific implementation actions, \\nsymptoms and warning signs of risk, residual and secondary risks, a watch list of low-priority risks, and the time \\nand cost contingency reserves. the watch list is within the risk register and provides a list of low-priority risks.\\n11.6.1.3 work performance data\\ndescribed in section 4.3.3.2. work_performance_data related to performance_results.work_performance_data include:\\n•\\t deliverable status,\\n•\\t schedule progress, and\\n•\\t costs incurred.\\n11.6.1.4 work performance reports\\ndescribed in section 4.4.3.2. work performance reports take information from performance measurements \\nand analyze it to provide project work performance information including variance analysis, earned value data, and \\nforecasting data. these data points could be impactful in controlling performance related risks.\\n11.6.2 control risks: tools and techniques\\n\\n11.6.2.1 risk reassessment\\ncontrol risks often results in identification of new risks, reassessment of current risks, and the closing of risks \\nthat are outdated. project risk reassessments should be regularly scheduled. the amount and detail of repetition \\nthat are appropriate depends on how the project progresses relative to its objectives.\\n11.6.2.2 risk audits\\nrisk audits examine and document the effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with identified risks and their \\nroot causes, as well as the effectiveness of the risk management process. the project manager is responsible for \\nensuring that risk audits are performed at an appropriate frequency, as defined in the project risk management \\nplan. risk audits may be included during routine project review meetings, or the team may choose to hold separate \\nrisk audit meetings. the format for the audit and its objectives should be clearly defined before the audit is conducted.\\n11.6.2.3 variance and trend analysis\\nmany control processes employ variance analysis to compare the planned results to the actual results. for the \\npurposes of controlling risks, trends in the project execution should be reviewed using performance information. \\nearned value analysis and other methods of project variance and trend analysis may be used for monitoring overall \\nproject performance. outcomes from these analyses may forecast potential deviation of the project at completion \\nfrom cost and schedule targets. deviation from the baseline plan may indicate the potential impact of threats or \\nopportunities.\\n11.6.2.4 technical performance measurement\\ntechnical performance measurement compares technical accomplishments during project execution to the \\nschedule of technical achievement. it requires the definition of objective, quantifiable measures of technical \\nperformance, which can be used to compare actual results against targets. such technical performance measures \\nmay include weight, transaction times, number of delivered defects, storage capacity, etc. deviation such as \\ndemonstrating more or less functionality than planned at a milestone, can help to forecast the degree of success \\nin achieving the project scope.\\n11.6.2.5 reserve analysis\\nthroughout execution of the project, some risks may occur with positive or negative impacts on budget or \\nschedule contingency reserves. reserve analysis compares the amount of the contingency reserves remaining to \\nthe amount of risk remaining at any time in the project in order to determine if the remaining reserve is adequate.\\n11.6.2.6 meetings\\nproject risk management should be an agenda item at periodic status meetings. the amount of time required \\nfor that item will vary, depending upon the risks that have been identified, their priority, and difficulty of response. \\nthe more often risk management is practiced, the easier it becomes. frequent discussions about risk make it more \\nlikely that people will identify risks and opportunities.\\n11.6.3 control risks: outputs\\n11.6.3.1 work performance information\\nwork performance information, as a control risks output, provides a mechanism to communicate and support \\nproject decision making.\\n11.6.3.2 change requests\\nimplementing contingency plans or workarounds sometimes results in a change request. change requests are \\nprepared and submitted to the perform integrated change control process (section 4.5). change_requests include:\\n•\\t recommended corrective actions. these are activities that realign the performance of the project \\nwork with the project management plan. they include contingency plans and workarounds. the latter \\nare responses that were not initially planned, but are required to deal with emerging risks that were \\npreviously unidentified or accepted passively. \\n•\\t recommended preventive actions. these are activities that ensure that future performance of the \\nproject work is aligned with the project management plan.\\n11.6.3.3 project management plan updates\\nif the approved change requests have an effect on the risk management processes, the corresponding component \\ndocuments of the project management plan are revised and reissued to reflect the approved changes. the elements \\nof the project management plan that may be updated are the same as those in the plan risk responses process.\\n11.6.3.4 project documents updates\\nproject documents that may be updated as a result of the control risk process include the \\nrisk register. risk register updates may include:\\n•\\t outcomes of risk reassessments, risk audits, and periodic risk reviews. these outcomes may \\ninclude identification of new risks, updates to probability, impact, priority, response plans, ownership, and \\nother elements of the risk register. outcomes can also include closing risks that are no longer applicable \\nand releasing their associated reserves.\\n•\\t actual outcomes of the project risks and of the risk responses. this information can help project \\nmanagers to plan for risk throughout their organizations, as well as on future projects. \\n11.6.3.5 organizational process assets updates\\nthe risk management processes produce information that may be used for future projects, and should be \\ncaptured in the organizational process assets. the organizational process assets that may be updated include, but \\nare not limited to:\\n•\\t templates for the risk management plan include the probability and impact matrix and risk register,\\n•\\t risk breakdown structure, and\\n•\\t lessons learned from the project risk management activities.\\nthese documents should be updated as needed and at project closure. final versions of the risk register and the \\nrisk management plan templates, checklists, and risk breakdown structure are included.\\n'}"

       "'project risk management includes the processes of conducting risk management planning, identification, \\nanalysis, response planning, and controlling risk on a project. the objectives of project risk management are to \\nincrease the likelihood and impact of positive events, and decrease the likelihood and impact of negative events \\nin the project.\\nfigure 11-1 provides an overview of the project risk management processes, which are as follows:\\n11.1  plan risk management—the process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a \\nproject.\\n11.2  identify risks—the process of determining which risks may affect the project and documenting \\n\\ntheir characteristics.\\n11.3  perform qualitative risk analysis—the process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action \\nby assessing and combining their probability of occurrence and impact.\\n11.4  perform quantitative risk analysis—the process of numerically analyzing the effect of identified \\nrisks on overall project objectives.\\n11.5  plan risk responses—the process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and \\nto reduce threats to project objectives.\\n11.6  control risks—the process of implementing risk response plans, tracking identified risks, monitoring \\nresidual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project.\\nthese processes interact with each other and with processes in other knowledge areas as described in detail \\nin section 3 and annex a1.\\nproject risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or \\nmore project objectives such as scope, schedule, cost, and quality. a risk may have one or more causes and, \\nif it occurs, it may have one or more impacts. a cause may be a given or potential requirement, assumption, \\nconstraint, or condition that creates the possibility of negative or positive outcomes. for example, causes could \\ninclude the requirement of an environmental permit to do work, or having limited personnel assigned to design the \\nproject. the risk is that the permitting agency may take longer than planned to issue a permit; or, in the case of \\nan opportunity, additional development personnel may is available who can participate in design, and they \\ncan be assigned to the project. if either of these uncertain events occurs, there may be an impact on the project, \\nscope, cost, schedule, quality, or performance. risk conditions may include aspects of the project or organization \\nenvironment that contribute to project risk such as immature project management practices, lack of integrated \\nmanagement systems, concurrent multiple projects, or dependency on external participants who are outside the \\nproject direct control.\\nproject risk has its origins in the uncertainty present in all projects. known risks are those that have been \\nidentified and analyzed, making it possible to plan responses for those risks. known risks that cannot be managed \\nproactively, should be assigned a contingency reserve. unknown risks cannot be managed proactively and therefore \\nmay be assigned a management reserve. a negative project risk that has occurred is considered an issue.\\nindividual project risks are different from overall project risk. overall project risk represents the effect of \\nuncertainty on the project as a whole. it is more than the sum of the individual risks within a project, since it includes \\nall sources of project uncertainty. it represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in \\nproject outcome, both positive and negative.\\norganizations perceive risk as the effect of uncertainty on projects and organizational objectives. organizations \\nand stakeholders are willing to accept varying degrees of risk depending on their risk attitude. the risk attitudes of \\nboth the organization and the stakeholders may be influenced by a number of factors, which are broadly classified \\ninto three themes:\\n•\\t risk appetite, which is the degree of uncertainty an entity is willing to take on in anticipation of a reward.\\n•\\t risk tolerance, which is the degree, amount, or volume of risk that an organization or individual will \\nwithstand.\\n•\\t risk threshold, which refers to measures along the level of uncertainty or the level of impact at which a \\nstakeholder may have a specific interest. below that risk threshold, the organization will accept the risk. \\nabove that risk threshold, the organization will not tolerate the risk.\\nfor example, an organization risk attitude may include its appetite for uncertainty, its threshold for risk levels \\nthat are unacceptable, or its risk tolerance at which point the organization may select a different risk response.\\npositive and negative risks are commonly referred to as opportunities and threats. the project may be accepted \\nif the risks are within tolerances and are in balance with the rewards that may be gained by taking the risks. positive \\nrisks that offer opportunities within the limits of risk tolerances may be pursued in order to generate enhanced \\nvalue. for example, adopting an aggressive resource optimization technique is a risk taken in anticipation of a \\nreward for using fewer resources.\\nindividuals and groups adopt attitudes toward risk that influence the way they respond. these risk attitudes are \\n\\ndriven by perception, tolerances, and other biases, which should be made explicit wherever possible. a consistent \\napproach to risk should be developed for each project, and communication about risk and its handling should \\nbe open and honest. risk responses reflect an organization perceived balance between risk taking and risk \\navoidance.\\nto be successful, an organization should be committed to address risk management proactively and consistently \\nthroughout the project. a conscious choice should be made at all levels of the organization to actively identify and \\npursue effective risk management during the life of the project. project risk could exist at the moment a project \\nis initiated. moving forward on a project without a proactive focus on risk management is likely to lead to more \\nproblems arising from unmanaged threats.\\n11.1 plan risk management\\nplan risk management is the process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project. the \\nkey benefit of this process is it ensures that the degree, type, and visibility of risk management are commensurate \\nwith both the risks and the importance of the project to the organization. the risk management plan is vital to \\ncommunicate with and obtain agreement and support from all stakeholders to ensure the risk management process \\nis supported and performed effectively over the project life cycle. the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of \\nthis process are depicted in figure 11-2. figure 11-3 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\ncareful and explicit planning enhances the probability of success for other risk management processes. planning \\nis also important to provide sufficient resources and time for risk management activities and to establish an agreed-\\nupon basis for evaluating risks. the plan risk management process should begin when a project is conceived and \\nshould be completed early during project planning.\\n11.1.1 plan risk management: inputs\\n11.1.1.1 project management plan\\nin planning risk management, all approved subsidiary management plans and baselines should be taken into \\nconsideration in order to make the risk management plan consistent with them. the risk management plan is also \\na component of the project management plan. the project management plan provides baseline or current state of \\nrisk-affected areas including scope, schedule, and cost.\\n11.1.1.2 project charter\\ndescribed in section 4.1.3.1. the project charter can provide various inputs such as high-level risks, high-level \\nproject descriptions, and high-level requirements.\\n11.1.1.3 stakeholder register\\ndescribed in section 13.1.3.1. the stakeholder register, which contains all details related to the project \\nstakeholders, provides an overview of their roles.\\n11.1.1.4 enterprise environmental factors\\ndescribed in section 2.1.5. the enterprise environmental factors that can influence the plan risk management \\nprocess include risk attitudes, thresholds, and tolerances that describe the degree of risk \\nthat an organization will withstand.\\n11.1.1.5 organizational process assets\\ndescribed in section 2.1.4. the organizational process assets that can influence the plan risk management \\nprocess include:\\n•\\t risk categories,\\n•\\t common definitions of concepts and terms,\\n•\\t risk statement formats,\\n•\\t standard templates,\\n•\\t roles and responsibilities,\\n•\\t authority levels for decision making, and\\n•\\t lessons learned.\\n11.1.2 plan risk management: tools and techniques\\n11.1.2.1 analytical techniques\\nanalytical techniques are used to understand and define the overall risk management context of the project. \\nrisk management context is a combination of stakeholder risk attitudes and the strategic risk exposure of a given \\n\\nproject based on the overall project context. for example, a stakeholder risk profile analysis may be performed to \\ngrade and qualify the project stakeholder risk appetite and tolerance. other techniques such as the use of strategic \\nrisk scoring sheets, are used to provide a high-level assessment of the risk exposure of the project based on the \\noverall project context. depending on these assessments, the project team can allocate appropriate resources and \\nfocus on the risk management activities.\\n11.1.2.2 expert judgment\\nexpert_judgment considered from groups_or_individuals such as:\\n•\\t senior management,\\n•\\t project stakeholders,\\n•\\t project managers who have worked on projects in the same area (directly or through lessons learned),\\n•\\t subject matter experts (smes) in business or project area,\\n•\\t industry groups and consultants, and\\n•\\t professional and technical associations.\\n11.1.2.3 meetings\\nproject teams hold planning meetings to develop the risk management plan. attendees at these meetings may \\ninclude the project manager, selected project team members and stakeholders, anyone in the organization with \\nresponsibility to manage the risk planning and execution activities, and others, as needed.\\nhigh-level plans for conducting the risk management activities are defined in these meetings. risk management \\ncost elements and schedule activities should be developed for inclusion in the project budget and schedule, \\nrespectively. risk contingency reserve application approaches may be established or reviewed. risk management \\nresponsibilities should be assigned. general organizational templates for risk categories and definitions of terms \\nsuch as levels of risk, probability by type of risk, impact by type of objectives, and the probability and impact matrix \\nwill be tailored to the specific project. if templates for other steps in the process do not exist, they may be generated \\nin these meetings. the outputs of these activities are summarized in the risk management plan.\\n11.1.3 plan risk management: outputs\\n11.1.3.1 risk management plan\\nthe risk management plan is a component of the project management plan and describes how risk management \\nactivities will be structured and performed. the risk management plan include:\\n•\\t methodology. defines the approaches, tools, and data sources that will be used to perform risk \\nmanagement on the project.\\n•\\t roles and responsibilities. defines the lead, support, and risk management team members for each \\ntype of activity in the risk management plan, and clarifies their responsibilities.\\n•\\t budgeting. estimates funds needed, based on assigned resources, for inclusion in the cost baseline and \\nestablishes protocols for application of contingency and management reserves.\\n•\\t timing. defines when and how often the risk management processes will be performed throughout the \\nproject life cycle, establishes protocols for application of schedule contingency reserves, and establishes \\nrisk management activities for inclusion in the project schedule.\\n•\\t risk categories. provide a means for grouping potential causes of risk. several approaches can be \\nused, for example, a structure based on project objectives by category. a risk breakdown structure (rbs) \\nhelps the project team to look at many sources from which project risk may arise in a risk identification \\nexercise. different rbs structures will be appropriate for different types of projects. an organization can \\nuse a previously prepared custom categorization framework, which may take the form of a simple list of \\ncategories or may be structured into an rbs. the rbs is a hierarchical representation of risks according \\nto their risk categories. an example is shown in figure 11-4.\\nbeta distribution triangular distribution\\n0.1 0.1\\n\\n0.0 0.0\\nbeta and triangular distributions are frequently used in quantitative risk analysis. the data shown in the figure \\non the left (beta distribution) is one example of a family of such distributions determined by two \"shape \\nparameters\". other commonly used distributions include the uniform, normal and lognormal. in these charts \\nthe horizontal (x) axes represent possible values of time or cost and the vertical (y) axes represent relative \\nlikelihood. \\nfigure 11-4. example of a risk breakdown structure (rbs)\\n•\\t definitions of risk probability and impact. the quality and credibility of the risk analysis requires that \\ndifferent levels of risk probability and impact be defined that are specific to the project context. general \\ndefinitions of probability levels and impact levels are tailored to the individual project during the plan \\nrisk management process for use in subsequent processes. table 11-1 is an example of definitions of \\nnegative impacts that could be used in evaluating risk impacts related to four project objectives. (similar \\ntables may be established with a positive impact perspective). table 11-1 illustrates both relative and \\nnumerical (in this case, nonlinear) approaches.\\n•\\t probability and impact matrix. a probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the probability \\nof each risk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. risks are prioritized \\naccording to their potential implications for having an effect on the project objectives. a typical \\napproach to prioritizing risks is to use a look-up table or a probability and impact matrix. the specific \\ncombinations of probability and impact that lead to a risk being rated as “high,” “moderate,” or “low” \\nimportance are usually set by the organization.\\n•\\t revised stakeholders’ tolerances. stakeholders’ tolerances, as they apply to the specific project, may \\nbe revised in the plan risk management process.\\n•\\t reporting formats. reporting formats define how the outcomes of the risk management process will \\nbe documented, analyzed, and communicated. it describes the content and format of the risk register as \\nwell as any other risk reports required.\\n•\\t tracking. tracking documents how risk activities will be recorded for the benefit of the current project \\nand how risk management processes will be audited.\\n11.2 identify risks\\nidentify risks is the process of determining which risks may affect the project and documenting their \\ncharacteristics. the key benefit of this process is the documentation of existing risks and the knowledge and ability \\nit provides to the project team to anticipate events. the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process \\nare depicted in figure 11-5. figure 11-6 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\nparticipants in risk identification activities may include the following: project manager, project team members, \\nrisk management team (if assigned), customers, subject matter experts from outside the project team, end \\nusers, other project managers, stakeholders, and risk management experts. while these personnel are often key \\nparticipants for risk identification, all project personnel should be encouraged to identify potential risks.\\nidentify risks is an iterative process, because new risks may evolve or is known as the project progresses \\nthrough its life cycle. the frequency of iteration and participation in each cycle will vary by situation. the format of \\nthe risk statements should be consistent to ensure that each risk is understood clearly and unambiguously in order \\nto support effective analysis and response development. the risk statement should support the ability to compare \\nthe relative effect of one risk against others on the project. the process should involve the project team so they can \\ndevelop and maintain a sense of ownership and responsibility for the risks and associated risk response actions. \\nstakeholders outside the project team may provide additional objective information.\\n11.2.1 identify risks: inputs\\n11.2.1.1 risk management plan \\ndescribed in section 11.1.3.1. key elements of the risk management plan that contribute to the identify risks \\nprocess are the assignments of roles and responsibilities, provision for risk management activities in the budget \\nand schedule, and categories of risk, which are sometimes expressed as a risk breakdown structure (figure 11-4).\\n11.2.1.2 cost management plan\\ndescribed in section 7.1.3.1. the cost management plan provides processes and controls that can be used to \\nhelp identify risks across the project.\\n11.2.1.3 schedule management plan\\ndescribed in section 6.1.3.1. the schedule management plan provides insight to project time/schedule \\nobjectives and expectations which may be impacted by risks (known and unknown).\\n11.2.1.4 quality management plan\\ndescribed in section 8.1.3.1. the quality management plan provides a baseline of quality measures and metrics \\nfor use in identifying risks.\\n11.2.1.5 human resource management plan\\ndescribed in section 9.1.3.1. the human resource management plan provides guidance on how project human \\nresources should be defined, staffed, managed, and eventually released. it can also contain roles and responsibilities, \\nproject organization charts, and the staffing management plan, which form a key input to identify risk process.\\n11.2.1.6 scope baseline\\ndescribed in section 5.4.3.1. project assumptions are found in the project scope statement. uncertainty in \\nproject assumptions should be evaluated as potential causes of project risk.\\nthe wbs is a critical input to identifying risks as it facilitates an understanding of the potential risks at both \\nthe micro and macro levels. risks can be identified and subsequently tracked at summary, control account, and/or \\nwork package levels.\\n11.2.1.7 activity cost estimates\\ndescribed in section 7.2.3.1. activity cost estimate reviews are useful in identifying risks as they provide a \\nquantitative assessment of the likely cost to complete scheduled activities and ideally are expressed as a range, \\nwith the width of the range indicating the degree(s) of risk. the review may result in projections indicating the \\nestimate is either sufficient or insufficient to complete the activity .\\n11.2.1.8 activity duration estimates\\ndescribed in section 6.5.3.1. activity duration estimate reviews are useful in identifying risks related to the time \\nallowances for the activities or project as a whole, again with the width of the range of such estimates indicating \\nthe relative degree(s) of risk.\\n11.2.1.9 stakeholder register\\ndescribed in section 13.1.3.1. information about the stakeholders is useful for soliciting inputs to identify risks, \\nas this will ensure that key stakeholders, especially the stakeholder, sponsor, and customer are interviewed or \\notherwise participate during the identify risks process.\\n11.2.1.10 project documents\\nproject documents provide the project team with information about decisions that help better identify project \\nrisks. project documents improve cross-team and stakeholder communications and include:\\n•\\t project charter,\\n•\\t project schedule,\\n•\\t schedule network diagrams,\\n•\\t issue log,\\n•\\t quality checklist, and\\n•\\t other information proven to be valuable in identifying risks.\\n11.2.1.11 procurement documents\\ndefined in section 12.1.3.3. if the project requires external procurement of resources, procurement \\ndocuments is a key input to the identify risks process. the complexity and the level of detail of the \\n\\nprocurement documents should be consistent with the value of, and risks associated with, planned procurement.\\n11.2.1.12 enterprise environmental factors\\ndescribed in section 2.1.5. enterprise environmental factors that can influence the identify risks process \\ninclude:\\n•\\t published information include commercial databases,\\n•\\t academic studies,\\n•\\t published checklists,\\n•\\t benchmarking,\\n•\\t industry studies, and\\n•\\t risk attitudes.\\n11.2.1.13 organizational process assets\\ndescribed in section 2.1.4. organizational process assets that can influence the identify risks process include:\\n•\\t project files include actual data,\\n•\\t organizational and project process controls,\\n•\\t risk statement formats or templates, and\\n•\\t lessons learned.\\n11.2.2 identify risks: tools and techniques\\n11.2.2.1 documentation reviews\\na structured review of the project documentation may be performed include plans, assumptions, previous \\nproject files, agreements, and other information. the quality of the plans, as well as consistency between those \\nplans and the project requirements and assumptions, may be indicators of risk in the project.\\n11.2.2.2 information gathering techniques\\nexamples of information gathering techniques used in identifying risks can include:\\n•\\t brainstorming. the goal of brainstorming is to obtain a comprehensive list of project risks. the project \\nteam usually performs brainstorming, often with a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the \\nteam. ideas about project risk are generated under the leadership of a facilitator, either in a traditional \\nfree-form brainstorm session or structured mass interviewing techniques. categories of risk such as in a \\nrisk breakdown structure, can be used as a framework. risks are then identified and categorized by type \\nof risk and their definitions are refined.\\n•\\t delphi technique. the delphi technique is a way to reach a consensus of experts. project risk experts \\nparticipate in this technique anonymously. a facilitator uses a questionnaire to solicit ideas about the \\nimportant project risks. the responses are summarized and are then recirculated to the experts for \\nfurther comment. consensus may be reached in a few rounds of this process. the delphi technique helps \\nreduce bias in the data and keeps any one person from having undue influence on the outcome.\\n•\\t interviewing. interviewing experienced project participants, stakeholders, and subject matter experts \\nhelps to identify risks.\\n•\\t root cause analysis. root-cause analysis is a specific technique used to identify a problem, discover \\nthe underlying causes that lead to it, and develop preventive action.\\n11.2.2.3 checklist analysis\\nrisk identification checklists are developed based on historical information and knowledge that has been \\naccumulated from previous similar projects and from other sources of information. the lowest level of the rbs \\ncan also be used as a risk checklist. while a checklist may be quick and simple, it is impossible to build an \\nexhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid the effort of proper risk \\nidentification. the team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist. additionally, the checklist \\nshould be pruned from time to time to remove or archive related items. the checklist should be reviewed during \\nproject closure to incorporate new lessons learned and improve it for use on future projects.\\n11.2.2.4 assumptions analysis\\n\\nevery project and its plan is conceived and developed based on a set of hypotheses, scenarios, or assumptions. \\nassumptions analysis explores the validity of assumptions as they apply to the project. it identifies risks to the \\nproject from inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness of assumptions.\\n11.2.2.5 diagramming techniques\\nrisk diagramming techniques may include:\\n•\\t cause and effect diagrams. these are also known as ishikawa or fishbone diagrams and are useful for \\nidentifying causes of risks.\\n•\\t system or process flow charts. these show how various elements of a system interrelate and the \\nmechanism of causation.\\n•\\t influence diagrams. these are graphical representations of situations showing causal influences, time \\nordering of events, and other relationships among variables and outcomes, as shown in figure 11-7.\\n11.2.2.6 swot analysis\\nthis technique examines the project from each of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (swot) \\nperspectives to increase the breadth of identified risks by including internally generated risks. the technique starts \\nwith identification of strengths and weaknesses of the organization, focusing on either the project, organization, \\nor the business area in general. swot analysis then identifies any opportunities for the project that arise from \\norganizational strengths, and any threats arising from organizational weaknesses. the analysis also examines \\nthe degree to which organizational strengths offset threats, as well as identifying opportunities that may serve to \\novercome weaknesses.\\n11.2.2.7 expert judgment\\nrisks may be identified directly by experts with relevant experience with similar projects or business areas. \\nsuch experts should be identified by the project manager and invited to consider all aspects of the project and \\nsuggest possible risks based on their previous experience and areas of expertise. the experts’ bias should be taken \\ninto account in this process.\\n11.2.3 identify risks: outputs\\n11.2.3.1 risk register\\nthe primary output from identify risks is the initial entry into the risk register. the risk register is a document \\nin which the results of risk analysis and risk response planning are recorded. it contains the outcomes of the other \\nrisk management processes as they are conducted, resulting in an increase in the level and type of information \\ncontained in the risk register over time. the preparation of the risk register begins in the identify risks process \\n\\nwith the following information, and then is available to other project management and risk management \\nprocesses.risk_register include:\\n•\\t list of identified risks. the identified risks are described in as much detail as is reasonable. a \\nstructure for describing risks using risk statements may be applied, for example, event may occur \\ncausing impact, or if cause exists, event may occur leading to effect. in addition to the list of \\nidentified risks, the root causes of those risks may is more evident. these are the fundamental \\nconditions or events that may give rise to one or more identified risks. they should be recorded and \\nused to support future risk identification for this and other projects.\\n•\\t list of potential responses. potential responses to a risk may sometimes be identified during the identify \\nrisks process. these responses, if identified in this process, should be used as inputs to the plan risk \\nresponses process.\\n11.3 perform qualitative risk analysis\\nperform qualitative risk analysis is the process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action by assessing \\nand combining their probability of occurrence and impact. the key benefit of this process is that it enables project \\nmanagers to reduce the level of uncertainty and to focus on high-priority risks. the inputs, tools and techniques, \\nand outputs of this process are depicted in figure 11-8. figure 11-9 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\nperform qualitative risk analysis assesses the priority of identified risks using their relative probability or \\nlikelihood of occurrence, the corresponding impact on project objectives if the risks occur, as well as other \\nfactors such as the time frame for response and the organization risk tolerance associated with the project \\nconstraints of cost, schedule, scope, and quality. such assessments reflect the risk attitude of the project \\nteam and other stakeholders. effective assessment therefore requires explicit identification and management \\nof the risk approaches of key participants in the perform qualitative risk analysis process. where these risk \\napproaches introduce bias into the assessment of identified risks, attention should be paid to identifying bias \\nand correcting for it.\\nestablishing definitions of the levels of probability and impact can reduce the influence of bias. the time \\ncriticality of risk-related actions may magnify the importance of a risk. an evaluation of the quality of the \\navailable information on project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of the risk importance to the project.\\nperform qualitative risk analysis is usually a rapid and cost-effective means of establishing priorities for plan \\nrisk responses and lays the foundation for perform quantitative risk analysis, if required. the perform qualitative \\nrisk analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle, as defined in the project risk \\nmanagement plan. this process can lead into perform quantitative risk analysis (section 11.4) or directly into plan \\n\\nrisk responses (section 11.5).\\n11.3.1 perform qualitative risk analysis: inputs\\n11.3.1.1 risk management plan\\ndescribed in section 11.1.3.1. key elements of the risk management plan used in the perform qualitative risk \\nanalysis process include roles and responsibilities for conducting risk management, budgets, schedule activities \\nfor risk management, risk categories, definitions of probability and impact, the probability and impact matrix, \\nand revised stakeholders’ risk tolerances. these inputs are usually tailored to the project during the plan risk \\nmanagement process. if they are not available, they may be developed during the perform qualitative risk analysis \\nprocess.\\n11.3.1.2 scope baseline\\ndescribed in section 5.4.3.1. projects of a common or recurrent type tend to have more well-understood risks. \\nprojects using state-of-the-art or first-of-its-kind technology, and highly complex projects, tend to have more \\nuncertainty. this can be evaluated by examining the scope baseline.\\n11.3.1.3 risk register\\ndescribed in section 11.2.3.1. the risk register contains the information that will be used to assess and prioritize \\nrisks.\\n11.3.1.4 enterprise environmental factors\\ndescribed in section 2.1.5.entreprise_environmental_factors provide context_to_risk such as:\\n•\\t industry studies of similar projects by risk specialists, and\\n•\\t risk databases that may be available from industry or proprietary sources.\\n11.3.1.5 organizational process assets\\ndescribed in section 2.1.4. the organizational process assets that can influence the perform qualitative risk \\nanalysis process include information on prior, similar completed projects.\\n11.3.2 perform qualitative risk analysis: tools and techniques\\n11.3.2.1 risk probability and impact assessment\\nrisk probability assessment investigates the likelihood that each specific risk will occur. risk impact \\nassessment investigates the potential effect on a project objective such as schedule, cost, quality, or performance, \\nincluding both negative effects for threats and positive effects for opportunities.\\nprobability and impact are assessed for each identified risk. risks can be assessed in interviews or meetings \\nwith participants selected for their familiarity with the risk categories on the agenda. project team members and \\nknowledgeable persons external to the project are included.\\nthe level of probability for each risk and its impact on each objective is evaluated during the interview or meeting. \\nexplanatory detail include assumptions justifying the levels assigned, are also recorded. risk probabilities \\nand impacts are rated according to the definitions given in the risk management plan. risks with low ratings of \\nprobability and impact will be included within the risk register as part of the watch list for future monitoring.\\n11.3.2.2 probability and impact matrix\\nrisks can be prioritized for further quantitative analysis and planning risk responses based on their risk rating. \\nratings are assigned to risks based on their assessed probability and impact. evaluation of each risk importance \\nand priority for attention is typically conducted using a look-up table or a probability and impact matrix. such a \\nmatrix specifies combinations of probability and impact that lead to rating the risks as low, moderate, or high \\npriority. descriptive terms or numeric values can be used depending on organizational preference.\\neach risk is rated on its probability of occurrence and impact on an objective if it does occur. the organization \\nshould determine which combinations of probability and impact result in a classification of high risk, moderate risk, \\nand low risk. in a black-and-white matrix, these conditions are denoted using different shades of gray. specifically \\nin figure 11-10, the dark gray area (with the largest numbers) represents high risk: the medium gray area (with \\nthe smallest numbers) represents low risk, and the light gray area (with in-between numbers) represents moderate \\nrisk. usually, these risk-rating rules are specified by the organization in advance of the project and included in \\norganizational process assets. risk rating rules can be tailored in the plan risk management process to the specific \\nproject.\\nas illustrated in figure 11-10, an organization can rate a risk separately for each objective (such as cost, time, \\nand scope). in addition, it may develop ways to determine one overall rating for each risk. finally, opportunities \\nand threats are handled in the same matrix using definitions of the different levels of impact that are appropriate \\nfor each.\\nthe risk score helps guide risk responses. for example, risks that have a negative impact on objectives, \\notherwise known as threats if they occur, and that are in the high-risk (dark gray) zone of the matrix, may require \\npriority action and aggressive response strategies. threats found in the low-risk (medium gray) zone may not \\nrequire proactive management action beyond being placed in the risk register as part of the watch list or adding \\na contingency reserve. similarly for opportunities, those in the high-risk (dark gray) zone, which may be obtained \\nmost easily and offer the greatest benefit, should be targeted first. opportunities in the low-risk (medium gray) zone \\nshould be monitored.\\n11.3.2.3 risk data quality assessment\\nrisk data quality assessment is a technique to evaluate the degree to which the data about risks is useful \\nfor risk management. it involves examining the degree to which the risk is understood and the accuracy, quality, \\nreliability, and integrity of the data about the risk.\\nthe use of low-quality risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis of little use to the project. if data quality is \\nunacceptable, it may be necessary to gather better data. often, the collection of information about risks is difficult, \\nand consumes more time and resources than originally planned. the values used in the example in figure 11-10 \\nare representative. the numbers of steps in the scale are usually established when defining the risk attitude of the \\norganization.\\n11.3.2.4 risk categorization\\nrisks to the project can be categorized by sources of risk (such as using the rbs), the area of the project affected \\n(such as using the wbs), or other useful categories (such as project phase) to determine the areas of the project most \\nexposed to the effects of uncertainty. risks can also be categorized by common root causes. this technique helps \\ndetermine work packages, activities, project phases or even roles in the project, which can lead to the development \\nof effective risk responses.\\n11.3.2.5 risk urgency assessment\\nrisks requiring near-term responses may be considered more urgent to address. indicators of priority may \\ninclude probability of detecting the risk, time to affect a risk response, symptoms and warning signs, and the \\nrisk rating. in some qualitative analyses, the assessment of risk urgency is combined with the risk ranking that is \\ndetermined from the probability and impact matrix to give a final risk severity rating.\\n11.3.2.6 expert judgment\\nexpert judgment is required to assess the probability and impact of each risk to determine its location in \\nthe matrix shown in figure 11-10. experts generally are those having experience with similar, recent projects. \\ngathering expert judgment is often accomplished with the use of risk facilitation workshops or interviews. the \\nexperts’ bias should be taken into account in this process.\\n11.3.3 perform qualitative risk analysis: outputs\\n\\n11.3.3.1 project documents updates\\nproject documents that may be updated include:\\n•\\t risk  register  updates.  as  new  information  is  available  through  the  qualitative  risk \\nassessment, the risk register is updated. updates to the risk register may include assessments \\nof probability and impacts for each risk, risk ranking or scores, risk urgency information or risk \\ncategorization, and a watch list for low probability risks or risks requiring further analysis.\\n•\\t assumptions log updates. as new information is available through the qualitative risk \\nassessment, assumptions could change. the assumptions log needs to be revisited to accommodate \\nthis new information. assumptions may be incorporated into the project scope statement or in a \\nseparate assumptions log.\\n11.4 perform quantitative risk analysis\\nperform quantitative risk analysis is the process of numerically analyzing the effect of identified risks on overall \\nproject objectives. the key benefit of this process is that it produces quantitative risk information to support decision \\nmaking in order to reduce project uncertainty. the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are \\ndepicted in figure 11-11. figure 11-12 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\nperform quantitative risk analysis is performed on risks that have been prioritized by the perform qualitative \\nrisk analysis process as potentially and substantially impacting the project competing demands. the perform \\nquantitative risk analysis process analyzes the effect of those risks on project objectives. it is used mostly to \\nevaluate the aggregate effect of all risks affecting the project. when the risks drive the quantitative analysis, the \\nprocess may be used to assign a numerical priority rating to those risks individually.\\nperform quantitative risk analysis generally follows the perform qualitative risk analysis process. in some \\ncases, it may not be possible to execute the perform quantitative risk analysis process due to lack of sufficient \\ndata to develop appropriate models. the project manager should exercise expert judgment to determine the need \\nfor and the viability of quantitative risk analysis. the availability of time and budget, and the need for qualitative or \\nquantitative statements about risk and impacts, will determine which method(s) to use on any particular project. \\nperform quantitative risk analysis should be repeated, as needed, as part of the control risks process to determine \\nif the overall project risk has been satisfactorily decreased. trends may indicate the need for more or less focus on \\nappropriate risk management activities.\\n11.4.1 perform quantitative risk analysis: inputs\\n11.4.1.1 risk management plan\\ndescribed in section 11.1.3.1. the risk management plan provides guidelines, methods, and tools to be used in \\nquantitative risk analysis.\\n\\n11.4.1.2 cost management plan\\ndescribed in section 7.1.3.1. the cost management plan provides guidelines on establishing and managing risk \\nreserves.\\n11.4.1.3 schedule management plan\\ndescribed in section 6.1.3.1. the schedule management plan provides guidelines on establishing and managing \\nrisk reserves.\\n11.4.1.4 risk register\\ndescribed in section 11.2.3.1. the risk register is used as a reference point for performing quantitative risk \\nanalysis.\\n11.4.1.5 enterprise environmental factors\\ndescribed in section 2.1.5.entreprise_environmental_factors provide context_to_risk such as:\\n•\\t industry studies of similar projects by risk specialists, and\\n•\\t risk databases that may be available from industry or proprietary sources.\\n11.4.1.6 organizational process assets\\ndescribed in section 2.1.4. the organizational process assets that can influence the perform quantitative risk \\nanalysis process include information from prior, similar completed projects.\\n11.4.2 perform quantitative risk analysis: tools and techniques\\n11.4.2.1 data gathering and representation techniques\\n•\\t interviewing. interviewing techniques draw on experience and historical data to quantify the probability \\nand impact of risks on project objectives. the information needed depends upon the type of probability \\ndistributions that will be used. for instance, information would be gathered on the optimistic (low), \\npessimistic (high), and most likely scenarios for some commonly used distributions. examples of three-\\npoint estimates for cost are shown in figure 11-13. additional information on three-point estimates \\nappears in estimate activity durations (section 6.5) and estimate costs (section 7.2). documenting the \\nrationale of the risk ranges and the assumptions behind them are important components of the risk \\ninterview because they can provide insight on the reliability and credibility of the analysis.\\n•\\t probability distributions. continuous probability distributions, which are used extensively in modeling \\nand simulation, represent the uncertainty in values such as durations of schedule activities and costs \\nof project components. discrete distributions can be used to represent uncertain events such as the \\noutcome of a test or a possible scenario in a decision tree. two examples of widely used continuous \\ndistributions are shown in figure 11-14. these distributions depict shapes that are compatible with the \\ndata typically developed during the quantitative risk analysis. uniform distributions can be used if there \\nis no obvious value that is more likely than any other between specified high and low bounds such as in \\nthe early concept stage of design.\\n11.4.2.2 quantitative risk analysis and modeling techniques\\ncommonly used techniques use both event-oriented and project-oriented analysis approaches include:\\n•\\t sensitivity analysis. sensitivity analysis helps to determine which risks have the most potential \\nimpact on the project. it helps to understand how the variations in project objectives correlate with \\nvariations in different uncertainties. conversely, it examines the extent to which the uncertainty of \\neach project element affects the objective being studied when all other uncertain elements are held at \\ntheir baseline values. one typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram (figure 11-15), \\nwhich is useful for comparing relative importance and impact of variables that have a high degree of \\nuncertainty to those that are more stable. the tornado diagram is also helpful in analyzing risk-taking \\nscenarios enabled on specific risks whose quantitative analysis highlights possible benefits greater \\nthan corresponding identified negative impacts. a tornado diagram is a special type of bar chart used \\nin sensitivity analysis for comparing the relative importance of the variables. in a tornado diagram, \\nthe y-axis contains each type of uncertainty at base values, and the x-axis contains the spread or \\ncorrelation of the uncertainty to the studied output. in this figure, each uncertainty contains a horizontal \\nbar and is ordered vertically to show uncertainties with a decreasing spread from the base values.\\n•\\t expected monetary value analysis. expected monetary value (emv) analysis is a statistical concept \\nthat calculates the average outcome when the future includes scenarios that may or may not happen \\n. the emv of opportunities are generally expressed as positive values, \\nwhile those of threats are expressed as negative values. emv requires a risk-neutral assumption—\\nneither risk averse nor risk seeking. emv for a project is calculated by multiplying the value of each \\npossible outcome by its probability of occurrence and adding the products together. a common use of \\nthis type of analysis is a decision tree analysis (figure 11-16).\\n•\\t modeling and simulation. a project simulation uses a model that translates the specified detailed \\nuncertainties of the project into their potential impact on project objectives. simulations are typically \\nperformed using the monte carlo technique. in a simulation, the project model is computed many times \\n(iterated), with the input values (such as cost estimates or activity durations) chosen at random for each \\niteration from the probability distributions of these variables. a histogram (such as total cost or completion \\ndate) is calculated from the iterations. for a cost risk analysis, a simulation uses cost estimates. for a \\nschedule risk analysis, the schedule network diagram and duration estimates are used. the output from a \\ncost risk simulation using the three-element model and risk ranges is shown in figure 11-17. it illustrates \\nthe respective probability of achieving specific cost targets. similar curves can be developed for other \\nproject objectives.\\n11.4.2.3 expert judgment\\nexpert judgment (ideally using experts with relevant, recent experience) is required to identify potential cost \\nand schedule impacts, to evaluate probability, and to define inputs such as probability distributions into the tools.\\nexpert judgment also comes into play in the interpretation of the data. experts should be able to identify the \\nweaknesses of the tools as well as their strengths. experts may determine when a specific tool may or may not be \\nmore appropriate given the organization capabilities and culture.\\n11.4.3 perform quantitative risk analysis: outputs\\n11.4.3.1 project documents updates\\nproject documents are updated with information resulting from quantitative risk analysis. for example, risk \\nregister updates could include:\\n•\\t probabilistic analysis of the project. estimates are made of potential project schedule and cost  \\noutcomes listing the possible completion dates and costs with their associated confidence levels. \\nthis output, often expressed as a cumulative frequency distribution, is used with stakeholder risk \\ntolerances to permit quantification of the cost and time contingency reserves. such contingency \\nreserves are needed to bring the risk of overrunning stated project objectives to a level acceptable to \\nthe organization.\\n•\\t probability of achieving cost and time objectives. with the risks facing the project, the probability \\nof achieving project objectives under the current plan can be estimated using quantitative risk analysis \\nresults. for instance, in figure 11-17, the likelihood of achieving the cost estimate of us$41 million is \\nabout 12%.\\n•\\t prioritized list of quantified risks. this list includes those risks that pose the greatest threat or present \\nthe greatest opportunity to the project. these include the risks that may have the greatest effect on cost \\ncontingency and those that are most likely to influence the critical path. these risks may be evaluated, in \\nsome cases, through a tornado diagram generated as a result of the simulation analysis.\\n•\\t trends in quantitative risk analysis results. as the analysis is repeated, a trend may is apparent \\nthat leads to conclusions affecting risk responses. organizational historical information on project schedule, \\ncost, quality, and performance should reflect new insights gained through the perform quantitative risk \\nanalysis process. such history may take the form of a quantitative risk analysis report. this report may \\nbe separate from, or linked to, the risk register.\\n11.5 plan risk responses\\nplan risk responses is the process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and to reduce \\nthreats to project objectives. the key benefit of this process is that it addresses the risks by their priority, inserting \\nresources and activities into the budget, schedule and project management plan as needed. the inputs, tools and \\ntechniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in figure 11-18. figure 11-19 depicts the data flow diagram \\nof the process.\\nthe plan risk responses process follows the perform quantitative risk analysis process (if used). each risk \\nresponse requires an understanding of the mechanism by which it will address the risk. this is the mechanism \\nused to analyze if the risk response plan is having the desired effect. it includes the identification and assignment \\nof one person (an owner for risk response) to take responsibility for each agreed-to and funded risk response. risk \\nresponses should be appropriate for the significance of the risk, cost-effective in meeting the challenge, realistic \\nwithin the project context, agreed upon by all parties involved, and owned by a responsible person. selecting the \\noptimum risk response from several options is often required.\\nthe plan risk responses process presents commonly used approaches to planning responses to the risks. \\nrisks include threats and opportunities that can affect project success, and responses are discussed for each.\\n11.5.1 plan risk responses: inputs\\n11.5.1.1 risk management plan\\nimportant components of the risk management plan include roles and responsibilities, risk analysis definitions, \\n\\ntiming for reviews (and for eliminating risks from review), and risk thresholds for low, moderate, and high risks. risk \\nthresholds help identify those risks for which specific responses are needed.\\n11.5.1.2 risk register\\nthe risk register refers to identified risks, root causes of risks, lists of potential responses, risk owners, symptoms \\nand warning signs, the relative rating or priority list of project risks, risks requiring responses in the near term, risks \\nfor additional analysis and response, trends in qualitative analysis results, and a watch list, which is a list of low-\\npriority risks within the risk register.\\n11.5.2 plan risk responses: tools and techniques\\nseveral risk response strategies are available. the strategy or mix of strategies most likely to be effective \\nshould be selected for each risk. risk analysis tools such as decision tree analysis (section 11.4.2.2), can be \\nused to choose the most appropriate responses. specific actions are developed to implement that strategy, \\nincluding primary and backup strategies, as necessary. a fallback plan can be developed for implementation \\nif the selected strategy turns out not to be fully effective or if an accepted risk occurs. secondary risks should \\nalso be reviewed. secondary risks are risks that arise as a direct result of implementing a risk response. a \\ncontingency reserve is often allocated for time or cost. if developed, it may include identification of the conditions \\nthat trigger its use.\\n11.5.2.1 strategies for negative risks or threats\\nthree strategies, which typically deal with threats or risks that may have negative impacts on project objectives \\nif they occur, are: avoid, transfer, and mitigate. the fourth strategy, accept, can be used for negative risks or threats \\nas well as positive risks or opportunities. each of these risk response strategies have varied and unique influence \\non the risk condition. these strategies should be chosen to match the risk probability and impact on the project \\noverall objectives. avoidance and mitigation strategies are usually good strategies for critical risks with high impact, \\nwhile transference and acceptance are usually good strategies for threats that are less critical and with low overall \\nimpact. strategies_for_negative_risks_or_threats include:\\n•\\t avoid. risk avoidance is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to eliminate the threat or \\nprotect the project from its impact. it usually involves changing the project management plan to eliminate \\nthe threat entirely. the project manager may also isolate the project objectives from the risk impact or \\nchange the objective that is in jeopardy. examples of this include extending the schedule, changing the \\nstrategy, or reducing scope. the most radical avoidance strategy is to shut down the project entirely. \\nsome risks that arise early in the project can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, \\nimproving communication, or acquiring expertise.\\n•\\t transfer. risk transference is a risk response strategy whereby the project team shifts the impact of \\na threat to a third party, together with ownership of the response. transferring the risk simply gives \\nanother party responsibility for its management—it does not eliminate it. transferring does not mean \\ndisowning the risk by transferring it to a later project or another person without his or her knowledge or \\nagreement. risk transference nearly always involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on \\nthe risk. transferring liability for risk is most effective in dealing with financial risk exposure. transference \\ntools can be quite diverse and include the use of insurance, performance bonds, \\nwarranties, guarantees, etc. contracts or agreements may be used to transfer liability for specified risks \\nto another party. for example, when a buyer has capabilities that the seller does not possess, it may be \\nprudent to transfer some work and its concurrent risk contractually back to the buyer. in many cases, use \\nof a cost-plus contract may transfer the cost risk to the buyer, while a fixed-price contract may transfer \\nrisk to the seller.\\n•\\t mitigate. risk mitigation is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to reduce the \\nprobability of occurrence or impact of a risk. it implies a reduction in the probability and/or impact of an \\nadverse risk to be within acceptable threshold limits. taking early action to reduce the probability and/or \\nimpact of a risk occurring on the project is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the \\nrisk has occurred. adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable \\nsupplier are examples of mitigation actions. mitigation may require prototype development to reduce the \\nrisk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product. where it is not possible to reduce \\nprobability, a mitigation response might address the risk impact by targeting linkages that determine the \\nseverity. for example, designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the \\noriginal component.\\n•\\t accept. risk acceptance is a risk response strategy whereby the project team decides to acknowledge \\nthe risk and not take any action unless the risk occurs. this strategy is adopted where it is not possible \\nor cost-effective to address a specific risk in any other way. this strategy indicates that the project \\nteam has decided not to change the project management plan to deal with a risk, or is unable to identify \\nany other suitable response strategy. this strategy can be either passive or active. passive acceptance \\nrequires no action except to document the strategy, leaving the project team to deal with the risks as \\n\\nthey occur, and to periodically review the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly. the \\nmost common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve include amounts of \\ntime, money, or resources to handle the risks.\\n11.5.2.2 strategies for positive risks or opportunities\\nthree of the four responses are suggested to deal with risks with potentially positive impacts on project objectives. \\nthe fourth strategy, accept, can be used for negative risks or threats as well as positive risks or opportunities. strategies_for_positive_risks_or_opportunities include:\\n•\\t exploit. the exploit strategy may be selected for risks with positive impacts where the organization wishes \\nto ensure that the opportunity is realized. this strategy seeks to eliminate the uncertainty associated with \\na particular upside risk by ensuring the opportunity definitely happens. examples of directly exploiting \\nresponses include assigning an organization most talented resources to the project to reduce the time \\nto completion or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration required to \\nrealize project objectives.\\n•\\t enhance. the enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or the positive impacts of an \\nopportunity. identifying and maximizing key drivers of these positive-impact risks may increase the \\nprobability of their occurrence. examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to \\nan activity to finish early.\\n•\\t share. sharing a positive risk involves allocating some or all of the ownership of the opportunity to a \\nthird party who is best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project. examples of sharing \\nactions include forming risk-sharing partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures, \\nwhich can be established with the express purpose of taking advantage of the opportunity so that all \\nparties gain from their actions.\\n•\\t accept. accepting an opportunity is being willing to take advantage of the opportunity if it arises, but \\nnot actively pursuing it.\\n11.5.2.3 contingent response strategies\\nsome responses are designed for use only if certain events occur. for some risks, it is appropriate for \\nthe project team to make a response plan that will only be executed under certain predefined conditions, if \\nit is believed that there will be sufficient warning to implement the plan. events that trigger the contingency \\nresponse such as missing intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with a supplier, should be defined \\nand tracked. risk responses identified using this technique are often called contingency plans or fallback plans \\nand include identified triggering events that set the plans in effect.\\n11.5.2.4 expert judgment\\nexpert judgment is input from knowledgeable parties pertaining to the actions to be taken on a specific and \\ndefined risk. expertise may be provided by any group or person with specialized education, knowledge, skill, \\nexperience, or training in establishing risk responses.\\n11.5.3 plan risk responses: outputs\\n11.5.3.1 project management plan updates\\nelements of the project management plan that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include:\\n•\\t schedule management plan. the schedule management plan is updated to reflect changes in process \\nand practice driven by the risk responses. this may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to \\nresource loading and leveling, as well as updates to the schedule strategy.\\n•\\t cost management plan. the cost management plan is updated to reflect changes in process and \\npractice driven by the risk responses. this may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to \\ncost accounting, tracking, and reports, as well as updates to the budget strategy and how contingency \\nreserves are consumed.\\n•\\t quality management plan. the quality management plan is updated to reflect changes in process \\nand practice driven by the risk responses. this may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to \\nrequirements, quality assurance, or quality control, as well as updates to the requirements documentation.\\n•\\t procurement management plan. the procurement management plan may be updated to reflect \\nchanges in strategy such as alterations in the make-or-buy decision or contract type(s) driven by the risk \\nresponses.\\n•\\t human resource management plan. the staffing management plan, part of the human resource \\nmanagement plan, is updated to reflect changes in project organizational structure and resource \\n\\napplications driven by the risk responses. this may include changes in tolerance or behavior related to \\nstaff allocation, as well as updates to the resource loading.\\n•\\t scope baseline. because of new, modified or omitted work generated by the risk responses, the scope \\nbaseline may be updated to reflect those changes.\\n•\\t schedule baseline. because of new work (or omitted work) generated by the risk responses, the schedule \\nbaseline may be updated to reflect those changes.\\n•\\t cost baseline. because of new work (or omitted work) generated by the risk responses, the cost baseline \\nmay be updated to reflect those changes.\\n11.5.3.2 project documents updates\\nin the plan risk responses process, several project documents are updated as needed. for example, when \\nappropriate risk responses are chosen and agreed upon, they are included in the risk register. the risk register \\nshould be written to a level of detail that corresponds with the priority ranking and the planned response. often, the \\nhigh and moderate risks are addressed in detail. risks judged to be of low priority are included in a watch list for \\nperiodic monitoring. updates to the risk register can include:\\n•\\t risk owners and assigned responsibilities;\\n•\\t agreed-upon response strategies;\\n•\\t specific actions to implement the chosen response strategy;\\n•\\t trigger conditions, symptoms, and warning signs of a risk occurrence;\\n•\\t budget and schedule activities required to implement the chosen responses;\\n•\\t contingency plans and triggers that call for their execution;\\n•\\t fallback plans for use as a reaction to a risk that has occurred and the primary response proves to be \\ninadequate;\\n•\\t residual risks that are expected to remain after planned responses have been taken, as well as those that \\nhave been deliberately accepted;\\n•\\t secondary risks that arise as a direct outcome of implementing a risk response; and\\n•\\t contingency reserves that are calculated based on the quantitative risk analysis of the project and the \\norganization risk thresholds.\\nother project documents updated could include:\\n•\\t assumptions log updates. as new information is available through the application of risk \\nresponses, assumptions could change. the assumptions log needs to be revisited to accommodate this \\nnew information.\\n•\\t technical documentation updates. as new information is available through the application \\nof risk responses, technical approaches and physical deliverables may change. any supporting \\ndocumentation needs to be revisited to accommodate this new information.\\n•\\t change requests. planning for possible risk responses can often result in recommendations for changes \\nto the resources, activities, cost estimates, and other items identified during other planning processes. \\nwhen such recommendations are identified, change requests are generated and processed through the \\nperform integrated change control process.\\n11.6 control risks\\ncontrol risks is the process of implementing risk response plans, tracking identified risks, monitoring residual \\nrisks, identifying new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project. the key benefit of \\nthis process is that it improves efficiency of the risk approach throughout the project life cycle to continuously \\noptimize risk responses. the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in figure 11-20. \\nfigure 11-21 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\nplanned risk responses that are included in the risk register are executed during the life cycle of the project, but \\nthe project work should be continuously monitored for new, changing, and outdated risks.\\nthe control risks process applies techniques such as variance and trend analysis, which require the use of \\nperformance information generated during project execution. other purposes of the control risks process are to \\ndetermine if:\\n•\\t project assumptions are still valid,\\n•\\t analysis shows an assessed risk has changed or can be retired,\\n•\\t risk management policies and procedures are being followed, and\\n•\\t contingency reserves for cost or schedule should be modified in alignment with the current risk \\nassessment.\\ncontrol risks can involve choosing alternative strategies, executing a contingency or fallback plan, taking \\ncorrective action, and modifying the project management plan. the risk response owner reports periodically to the \\nproject manager on the effectiveness of the plan, any unanticipated effects, and any correction needed to handle \\nthe risk appropriately. control risks also includes updating the organizational process assets include project \\nlessons learned databases and risk management templates, for the benefit of future projects.\\n11.6.1 control risks: inputs\\n11.6.1.1 project management plan\\ndescribed in section 4.2.3.1. the project management plan, which includes the risk management plan, provides \\nguidance for risk monitoring and controlling.\\n11.6.1.2 risk register\\nthe risk register has key inputs that include identified risks and risk owners, agreed-upon risk responses, \\ncontrol actions for assessing the effectiveness of response plans, risk responses, specific implementation actions, \\nsymptoms and warning signs of risk, residual and secondary risks, a watch list of low-priority risks, and the time \\nand cost contingency reserves. the watch list is within the risk register and provides a list of low-priority risks.\\n11.6.1.3 work performance data\\ndescribed in section 4.3.3.2. work_performance_data related to performance_results.work_performance_data include:\\n•\\t deliverable status,\\n•\\t schedule progress, and\\n•\\t costs incurred.\\n11.6.1.4 work performance reports\\ndescribed in section 4.4.3.2. work performance reports take information from performance measurements \\nand analyze it to provide project work performance information including variance analysis, earned value data, and \\nforecasting data. these data points could be impactful in controlling performance related risks.\\n11.6.2 control risks: tools and techniques\\n\\n11.6.2.1 risk reassessment\\ncontrol risks often results in identification of new risks, reassessment of current risks, and the closing of risks \\nthat are outdated. project risk reassessments should be regularly scheduled. the amount and detail of repetition \\nthat are appropriate depends on how the project progresses relative to its objectives.\\n11.6.2.2 risk audits\\nrisk audits examine and document the effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with identified risks and their \\nroot causes, as well as the effectiveness of the risk management process. the project manager is responsible for \\nensuring that risk audits are performed at an appropriate frequency, as defined in the project risk management \\nplan. risk audits may be included during routine project review meetings, or the team may choose to hold separate \\nrisk audit meetings. the format for the audit and its objectives should be clearly defined before the audit is conducted.\\n11.6.2.3 variance and trend analysis\\nmany control processes employ variance analysis to compare the planned results to the actual results. for the \\npurposes of controlling risks, trends in the project execution should be reviewed using performance information. \\nearned value analysis and other methods of project variance and trend analysis may be used for monitoring overall \\nproject performance. outcomes from these analyses may forecast potential deviation of the project at completion \\nfrom cost and schedule targets. deviation from the baseline plan may indicate the potential impact of threats or \\nopportunities.\\n11.6.2.4 technical performance measurement\\ntechnical performance measurement compares technical accomplishments during project execution to the \\nschedule of technical achievement. it requires the definition of objective, quantifiable measures of technical \\nperformance, which can be used to compare actual results against targets. such technical performance measures \\nmay include weight, transaction times, number of delivered defects, storage capacity, etc. deviation such as \\ndemonstrating more or less functionality than planned at a milestone, can help to forecast the degree of success \\nin achieving the project scope.\\n11.6.2.5 reserve analysis\\nthroughout execution of the project, some risks may occur with positive or negative impacts on budget or \\nschedule contingency reserves. reserve analysis compares the amount of the contingency reserves remaining to \\nthe amount of risk remaining at any time in the project in order to determine if the remaining reserve is adequate.\\n11.6.2.6 meetings\\nproject risk management should be an agenda item at periodic status meetings. the amount of time required \\nfor that item will vary, depending upon the risks that have been identified, their priority, and difficulty of response. \\nthe more often risk management is practiced, the easier it becomes. frequent discussions about risk make it more \\nlikely that people will identify risks and opportunities.\\n11.6.3 control risks: outputs\\n11.6.3.1 work performance information\\nwork performance information, as a control risks output, provides a mechanism to communicate and support \\nproject decision making.\\n11.6.3.2 change requests\\nimplementing contingency plans or workarounds sometimes results in a change request. change requests are \\nprepared and submitted to the perform integrated change control process (section 4.5). change_requests include:\\n•\\t recommended corrective actions. these are activities that realign the performance of the project \\nwork with the project management plan. they include contingency plans and workarounds. the latter \\nare responses that were not initially planned, but are required to deal with emerging risks that were \\npreviously unidentified or accepted passively. \\n•\\t recommended preventive actions. these are activities that ensure that future performance of the \\nproject work is aligned with the project management plan.\\n11.6.3.3 project management plan updates\\nif the approved change requests have an effect on the risk management processes, the corresponding component \\ndocuments of the project management plan are revised and reissued to reflect the approved changes. the elements \\nof the project management plan that may be updated are the same as those in the plan risk responses process.\\n11.6.3.4 project documents updates\\nproject documents that may be updated as a result of the control risk process include the \\nrisk register. risk register updates may include:\\n•\\t outcomes of risk reassessments, risk audits, and periodic risk reviews. these outcomes may \\ninclude identification of new risks, updates to probability, impact, priority, response plans, ownership, and \\nother elements of the risk register. outcomes can also include closing risks that are no longer applicable \\nand releasing their associated reserves.\\n•\\t actual outcomes of the project risks and of the risk responses. this information can help project \\nmanagers to plan for risk throughout their organizations, as well as on future projects. \\n11.6.3.5 organizational process assets updates\\nthe risk management processes produce information that may be used for future projects, and should be \\ncaptured in the organizational process assets. the organizational process assets that may be updated include, but \\nare not limited to:\\n•\\t templates for the risk management plan include the probability and impact matrix and risk register,\\n•\\t risk breakdown structure, and\\n•\\t lessons learned from the project risk management activities.\\nthese documents should be updated as needed and at project closure. final versions of the risk register and the \\nrisk management plan templates, checklists, and risk breakdown structure are included.\\n'"

       "'project risk management includes the processes of conducting risk management planning, identification, \\nanalysis, response planning, and controlling risk on a project. the objectives of project risk management are to \\nincrease the likelihood and impact of positive events, and decrease the likelihood and impact of negative events \\nin the project.\\nfigure 11-1 provides an overview of the project risk management processes, which are as follows:\\n11.1  plan risk management—the process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a \\nproject.\\n11.2  identify risks—the process of determining which risks may affect the project and documenting \\n\\ntheir characteristics.\\n11.3  perform qualitative risk analysis—the process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action \\nby assessing and combining their probability of occurrence and impact.\\n11.4  perform quantitative risk analysis—the process of numerically analyzing the effect of identified \\nrisks on overall project objectives.\\n11.5  plan risk responses—the process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and \\nto reduce threats to project objectives.\\n11.6  control risks—the process of implementing risk response plans, tracking identified risks, monitoring \\nresidual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project.\\nthese processes interact with each other and with processes in other knowledge areas as described in detail \\nin section 3 and annex a1.\\nproject risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or \\nmore project objectives such as scope, schedule, cost, and quality. a risk may have one or more causes and, \\nif it occurs, it may have one or more impacts. a cause may be a given or potential requirement, assumption, \\nconstraint, or condition that creates the possibility of negative or positive outcomes. for example, causes could \\ninclude the requirement of an environmental permit to do work, or having limited personnel assigned to design the \\nproject. the risk is that the permitting agency may take longer than planned to issue a permit; or, in the case of \\nan opportunity, additional development personnel may is available who can participate in design, and they \\ncan be assigned to the project. if either of these uncertain events occurs, there may be an impact on the project, \\nscope, cost, schedule, quality, or performance. risk conditions may include aspects of the project or organization \\nenvironment that contribute to project risk such as immature project management practices, lack of integrated \\nmanagement systems, concurrent multiple projects, or dependency on external participants who are outside the \\nproject direct control.\\nproject risk has its origins in the uncertainty present in all projects. known risks are those that have been \\nidentified and analyzed, making it possible to plan responses for those risks. known risks that cannot be managed \\nproactively, should be assigned a contingency reserve. unknown risks cannot be managed proactively and therefore \\nmay be assigned a management reserve. a negative project risk that has occurred is considered an issue.\\nindividual project risks are different from overall project risk. overall project risk represents the effect of \\nuncertainty on the project as a whole. it is more than the sum of the individual risks within a project, since it includes \\nall sources of project uncertainty. it represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in \\nproject outcome, both positive and negative.\\norganizations perceive risk as the effect of uncertainty on projects and organizational objectives. organizations \\nand stakeholders are willing to accept varying degrees of risk depending on their risk attitude. the risk attitudes of \\nboth the organization and the stakeholders may be influenced by a number of factors, which are broadly classified \\ninto three themes:\\n•\\t risk appetite, which is the degree of uncertainty an entity is willing to take on in anticipation of a reward.\\n•\\t risk tolerance, which is the degree, amount, or volume of risk that an organization or individual will \\nwithstand.\\n•\\t risk threshold, which refers to measures along the level of uncertainty or the level of impact at which a \\nstakeholder may have a specific interest. below that risk threshold, the organization will accept the risk. \\nabove that risk threshold, the organization will not tolerate the risk.\\nfor example, an organization risk attitude may include its appetite for uncertainty, its threshold for risk levels \\nthat are unacceptable, or its risk tolerance at which point the organization may select a different risk response.\\npositive and negative risks are commonly referred to as opportunities and threats. the project may be accepted \\nif the risks are within tolerances and are in balance with the rewards that may be gained by taking the risks. positive \\nrisks that offer opportunities within the limits of risk tolerances may be pursued in order to generate enhanced \\nvalue. for example, adopting an aggressive resource optimization technique is a risk taken in anticipation of a \\nreward for using fewer resources.\\nindividuals and groups adopt attitudes toward risk that influence the way they respond. these risk attitudes are \\n\\ndriven by perception, tolerances, and other biases, which should be made explicit wherever possible. a consistent \\napproach to risk should be developed for each project, and communication about risk and its handling should \\nbe open and honest. risk responses reflect an organization perceived balance between risk taking and risk \\navoidance.\\nto be successful, an organization should be committed to address risk management proactively and consistently \\nthroughout the project. a conscious choice should be made at all levels of the organization to actively identify and \\npursue effective risk management during the life of the project. project risk could exist at the moment a project \\nis initiated. moving forward on a project without a proactive focus on risk management is likely to lead to more \\nproblems arising from unmanaged threats.'"

       "'Project_Risk_Management includes the processes of conducting Risk_Management_Planning, identification, \\n analysis, Response_Planning, and controlling risk on a project. the objectives of Project_Risk_Management are to\\n increase the likelihood and impact of positive events, and decrease the likelihood and impact of negative eventsin the project.\\n figure 11 - 1 provides an overview of the Project_Risk_Management_Processes, which are as follows:\\n 11.1  Plan_Risk_Management— the process of defining how to conduct Risk_Management_Activities for a\\n project.\\n 11.2  identify risks— the process of determining which risks may affect the project and documenting\\n\\n their characteristics.\\n 11.3  perform qualitative Risk_Analysis— the process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or actionby assessing and combining their probability of occurrence and impact.\\n 11.4  perform Quantitative_Risk_Analysis— the process of numerically analyzing the effect of Identified_\\n_Riskson overall Project_Objectives.\\n 11.5  Plan_Risk_Responses— the process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and\\n to reduce threats to Project_Objectives.\\n 11.6_ _Control_Risks— the process of implementing Risk_Response_Plans, tracking Identified_Risks, monitoring\\n residual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating Risk_Process_Effectiveness throughout the project.\\n these processes interact with each other and with processes in other Knowledge_Areas as described in detailin section 3 and Annex_A1_._\\n_Project_Risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or\\n more Project_Objectives such as scope, schedule, cost, and quality. a risk may have one or more causes and,\\n if it occurs, it may have one or more impacts. a cause may be a given or potential requirement, assumption, \\n constraint, or condition that creates the possibility of negative or positive outcomes. for example, causes could\\n include the requirement of an Environmental_Permit to do work, or having limited personnel assigned to design the\\n project. the risk is that the Permitting_Agency may take longer than planned to issue a permit; or, in the case of\\n an opportunity, additional Development_Personnel may is available who can participate in design, and they\\n can be assigned to the project. if either of these uncertain events occurs, there may be an impact on the project, \\n scope, cost, schedule, quality, or performance. Risk_Conditions may include aspects of the project or Organization_\\n_Environmentthat contribute to Project_Risk such as immature Project_Management_Practices, lack of integrated\\n Management_Systems, concurrent multiple projects, or dependency on External_Participants who are outside the\\n project direct control.\\n Project_Risk has its origins in the uncertainty present in all projects. known risks are those that have been\\n identified and analyzed, making it possible to plan responses for those risks. known risks that can not be managed\\n proactively, should be assigned a Contingency_Reserve. unknown risks can not be managed proactively and therefore\\n may be assigned a Management_Reserve. a negative Project_Risk that has occurred is considered an issue.\\n Individual_Project_Risks are different from overall Project_Risk. overall Project_Risk represents the effect of\\n uncertainty on the project as a whole. it is more than the sum of the Individual_Risks within a project, since it includes\\n all sources of Project_Uncertainty. it represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in\\n Project_Outcome, both positive and negative.\\n organizations perceive risk as the effect of uncertainty on projects and Organizational_Objectives. organizationsand stakeholders are willing to accept varying degrees of risk depending on their Risk_Attitude. the Risk_Attitudes of\\n both the organization and the stakeholders may be influenced by a number of factors, which are broadly classified\\n into three themes: \\n•\\t  Risk_Appetite, which is the degree of uncertainty an entity is willing to take on in anticipation of a reward.\\n•\\t  Risk_Tolerance, which is the degree, amount, or volume of risk that an organization or individual will\\n withstand.\\n•\\t  Risk_Threshold, which refers to measures along the level of uncertainty or the level of impact at which a\\n stakeholder may have a specific interest. below that Risk_Threshold, the organization will accept the risk.\\n above that Risk_Threshold, the organization will not tolerate the risk.\\n for example, an Organization_Risk_Attitude may include its appetite for uncertainty, its threshold for Risk_Levels that are unacceptable, or its Risk_Tolerance at which point the organization may select a different Risk_Response.\\n positive and negative risks are commonly referred to as opportunities and threats. the project may be accepted\\n if the risks are within tolerances and are in balance with the rewards that may be gained by taking the risks. positive\\n risks that offer opportunities within the limits of Risk_Tolerances may be pursued in order to generate enhanced\\n value. for example, adopting an aggressive Resource_Optimization_Technique is a risk taken in anticipation of a\\n reward for using fewer resources.\\n individuals and groups adopt attitudes toward risk that influence the way they respond. these Risk_Attitudes are\\n\\n driven by perception, tolerances, and other biases, which should be made explicit wherever possible. a consistent\\n approach to risk should be developed for each project, and communication about risk and its handling should\\n be open and honest. Risk_Responses reflect an organization perceived balance between Risk_Taking and Risk_\\n_Avoidance.\\n to be successful, an organization should be committed to address Risk_Management proactively and consistently\\n throughout the project. a conscious choice should be made at all levels of the organization to actively identify and\\n pursue effective Risk_Management during the life of the project. Project_Risk could exist at the moment a projectis initiated. moving forward on a project without a proactive focus on Risk_Management is likely to lead to more\\n problems arising from Unmanaged_Threats .'"

Information_Gathering_Techniques include Brainstorming. Information_Gathering_Techniques include Delphi_Technique. Information_Gathering_Techniques include Interviewing. Information_Gathering_Techniques include Root_Cause_Analysis. brainstorming the goal of brainstorming is to obtain a comprehensive list of Project_Risks the Project_Team usually performs brainstorming, often with a multidisciplinary set of experts who are not part of the team ideas about Project_Risk are generated under the leadership of a facilitator, either in a traditional Free_Form_Brainstorm_Session or structured Mass_Interviewing_Techniques categories of risk such as in a Risk_Breakdown_Structure, can be used as a framework risks are then identified and categorized by type of risk and their definitions are refined.. Delphi_Technique the Delphi_Technique is a way to reach a consensus of experts Project_Risk_Experts participate in this Identify_Risks_Tools_And_Techniques anonymously a facilitator uses a questionnaire to solicit ideas about the important Project_Risks the responses are summarized and are then recirculated to the experts for further comment consensus may be reached in a few rounds of this process the Delphi_Technique helps reduce bias in the data and keeps any one person from having undue influence on the outcome.. interviewing interviewing experienced Project_Participants, stakeholders, and Subject_Matter_Experts helps to identify risks.. root cause analysis Root_Cause analysis is a specific Identify_Risks_Tools_And_Techniques used to identify a problem, discover the underlying causes that lead to it, and develop Preventive_Action.\\nRisk_Identification_Checklists are developed based on Historical_Information and knowledge that has been accumulated from previous similar projects and from other sources of information. the lowest level of the rbs can also be used as a Risk_Checklist. while a checklist may be quick and simple, it is impossible to build an exhaustive one, and care should be taken to ensure the checklist is not used to avoid the effort of proper Risk_Identification. the team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist. additionally, the checklist should be pruned from time to time to remove or archive related items. the checklist should be reviewed during Project_Closure to incorporate new lessons learned and improve it for use on future projects.\\n\\n every project and its plan is conceived and developed based on a set of hypotheses, scenarios, or assumptions.

Risk_Rating_Rules can be tailored in the Plan_Risk_Management_Process to the specific project.\\n as illustrated in figure 11 - 10, an organization can rate a risk separately for each objective( such as cost, time, and scope) . in addition, it may develop ways to determine one overall rating for each risk. finally, opportunities and threats are handled in the same matrix using definitions of the different levels of impact that are appropriate for each.\\n the Risk_Score helps guide Risk_Responses. for example, risks that have a negative impact on objectives, otherwise known as threats if they occur, and that are in the High_Risk( dark gray) zone of the matrix, may require Priority_Action and aggressive Response_Strategies. threats found in the Low_Risk( medium gray) zone may not require proactive Management_Action beyond being placed in the Risk_Register as part of the Watch_List or adding a Contingency_Reserve. similarly for opportunities, those in the High_Risk( dark gray) zone, which may be obtained most easily and offer the greatest benefit, should be targeted first. opportunities in the Low_Risk( medium gray) zone should be monitored.\\nRisk_Data_Quality_Assessment is a Perform_Qualitative_Risk_Analysis_Tools_And_Techniques to evaluate the degree to which the data about risks is useful for Risk_Management. it involves examining the degree to which the risk is understood and the accuracy, quality, reliability, and integrity of the data about the risk.\\n the use of Low_Quality_Risk_Data may lead to a qualitative Risk_Analysis of little use to the project. if Data_Quality is unacceptable, it may be necessary to gather better data. often, the collection of information about risks is difficult, and consumes more time and resources than originally planned. the values used in the example in figure 11 - 10 are representative. the numbers of steps in the scale are usually established when defining the Risk_Attitude of the organization.\\nrisks to the project can be categorized by sources of risk( such as using the rbs) , the area of the project affected( such as using the wbs) , or other useful categories( such as Project_Phase) to determine the areas of the project most exposed to the effects of uncertainty. risks can also be categorized by common Root_Causes. this Perform_Qualitative_Risk_Analysis_Tools_And_Techniques helps determine Work_Packages, activities, Project_Phases or even roles in the project, which can lead to the development of effective Risk_Responses.\\nrisks requiring Near_Term_Responses may be considered more urgent to address. indicators of priority may include probability of detecting the risk, time to affect a Risk_Response, symptoms and Warning_Signs, and the Risk_Rating. in some qualitative analyses, the assessment of Risk_Urgency is combined with the Risk_Ranking that is determined from the probability and Impact_Matrix to give a final Risk_Severity_Rating.\\nPerform_Qualitative_Risk_Analysis_Expert_Judgment is required to assess the probability and impact of each risk to determine its location in the matrix shown in figure 11 - 10. experts generally are those having experience with similar, recent projects. gathering Perform_Qualitative_Risk_Analysis_Expert_Judgment is often accomplished with the use of Risk_Facilitation_Workshops or interviews. the experts ’ bias should be taken into account in this process.\\n.\\n.

Prioritized_List of Quantified_Risks this list includes those risks that pose the greatest threat or present the greatest opportunity to the project these include the risks that may have the greatest effect on Cost_Contingency and those that are most likely to influence the critical path these risks may be evaluated, in some cases, through a Tornado_Diagram generated as a result of the Simulation_Analysis.. trends in Quantitative_Risk_Analysis_Results as the analysis is repeated, a trend may is apparent that leads to conclusions affecting Risk_Responses Organizational_Historical_Information on Project_Schedule, cost, quality, and performance should reflect new insights gained through the Perform_Quantitative_Risk_Analysis_Process such history may take the form of a Quantitative_Risk_Analysis_Report this report may be separate from, or linked to, the Risk_Register.\\nimportant components of the Plan_Risk_Responses_Risk_Management_Plan include roles and responsibilities, Risk_Analysis_Definitions, timing for reviews( and for eliminating risks from review) , and Risk_Thresholds for low, moderate, and high risks. Risk_Thresholds help identify those risks for which specific responses are needed.\\nthe Plan_Risk_Responses_Risk_Register refers to Identified_Risks, Root_Causes of risks, lists of Potential_Responses, Risk_Owners, symptoms and Warning_Signs, the relative rating or Priority_List of Project_Risks, risks requiring responses in the near term, risks for additional analysis and response, trends in qualitative Analysis_Results, and a Watch_List, which is a list of Low_Priority_Risks within the Plan_Risk_Responses_Risk_Register.\\nthree strategies, which typically deal with threats or risks that may have negative impacts on Project_Objectives if they occur, are: avoid, transfer, and mitigate. the fourth strategy, accept, can be used for negative risks or threats as well as positive risks or opportunities. each of these Risk_Response_Strategies have varied and unique influence on the Risk_Condition. these strategies should be chosen to match the Risk_Probability and impact on the project overall objectives. avoidance and Mitigation_Strategies are usually good strategies for critical risks with high impact, while transference and acceptance are usually good strategies for threats that are less critical and with low overall impact.\\n. Strategies_For_Negative_Risks_Or_Threats include Avoid. Strategies_For_Negative_Risks_Or_Threats include Transfer. Strategies_For_Negative_Risks_Or_Threats include Mitigate. Strategies_For_Negative_Risks_Or_Threats include Accept. avoid Risk_Avoidance is a Risk_Response_Strategy whereby the Project_Team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its impact it usually involves changing the Project_Management_Plan to eliminate the threat entirely the Project_Manager may also isolate the Project_Objectives from the Risk_Impact or change the objective that is in jeopardy examples of this include extending the schedule, changing the strategy, or reducing scope the most radical Avoidance_Strategy is to shut down the project entirely some risks that arise early in the project can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, improving communication, or acquiring expertise.. transfer Risk_Transference is a Risk_Response_Strategy whereby the Project_Team shifts the impact of a threat to a third party, together with ownership of the response transferring the risk simply gives another Party_Responsibility for its management— it does not eliminate it transferring does not mean disowning the risk by transferring it to a later project or another person without his or her knowledge or agreement Risk_Transference nearly always involves payment of a Risk_Premium to the party taking on the risk transferring liability for risk is most effective in dealing with financial Risk_Exposure Transference_Tools can be quite diverse and include the use of insurance, Performance_Bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc contracts or agreements may be used to transfer liability for specified risks to another party for example, when a buyer has capabilities that the seller does not possess, it may be prudent to transfer some work and its concurrent risk contractually back to the buyer in many cases, use of a Cost_Plus_Contract may transfer the Cost_Risk to the buyer, while a Fixed_Price_Contract may transfer risk to the seller.. mitigate Risk_Mitigation is a Risk_Response_Strategy whereby the Project_Team acts to reduce the probability of occurrence or impact of a risk it implies a reduction in the probability and/or impact of an adverse risk to be within acceptable Threshold_Limits taking early action to reduce the probability and/or impact of a risk occurring on the project is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the risk has occurred adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable supplier are examples of Mitigation_Actions mitigation may require Prototype_Development to reduce the risk of scaling up from a Bench_Scale_Model of a process or product where it is not possible to reduce probability, a Mitigation_Response might address the Risk_Impact by targeting linkages that determine the severity for example, Designing_Redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component.. accept Risk_Acceptance is a Risk_Response_Strategy whereby the Project_Team decides to acknowledge the risk and not take any action unless the risk occurs this strategy is adopted where it is not possible or Cost_Effective to address a specific risk in any other way this strategy indicates that the Project_Team has decided not to change the Project_Management_Plan to deal with a risk, or is unable to identify any other suitable Response_Strategy this strategy can be either passive or active passive acceptance requires no action except to document the strategy, leaving the Project_Team to deal with the risks as they occur, and to periodically review the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly the most common active Acceptance_Strategy is to establish a Contingency_Reserve include amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the risks.\\nthree of the four responses are suggested to deal with risks with potentially positive impacts on Project_Objectives. the fourth strategy, accept, can be used for negative risks or threats as well as positive risks or opportunities.\\n. Strategies_For_Positive_Risks_Or_Opportunities include Exploit. Strategies_For_Positive_Risks_Or_Opportunities include Enhance. Strategies_For_Positive_Risks_Or_Opportunities include Share. Strategies_For_Positive_Risks_Or_Opportunities include Accept. exploit the Exploit_Strategy may be selected for risks with positive impacts where the organization wishes to ensure that the opportunity is realized this strategy seeks to eliminate the uncertainty associated with a particular upside risk by ensuring the opportunity definitely happens examples of directly exploiting responses include assigning an organization most talented resources to the project to reduce the time to completion or using new technologies or Technology_Upgrades to reduce cost and duration required to realize Project_Objectives.. enhance the Enhance_Strategy is used to increase the probability and/or the positive impacts of an opportunity identifying and maximizing key drivers of these Positive_Impact_Risks may increase the probability of their occurrence examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to an activity to finish early.. share sharing a positive risk involves allocating some or all of the ownership of the opportunity to a third party who is best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project examples of Sharing_Actions include forming Risk_Sharing_Partnerships, teams, Special_Purpose_Companies, or joint ventures, which can be established with the express purpose of taking advantage of the opportunity so that all parties gain from their actions.. accept accepting an opportunity is being willing to take advantage of the opportunity if it arises, but not actively pursuing it.\\nsome responses are designed for use only if certain events occur. for some risks, it is appropriate for the Project_Team to make a Response_Plan that will only be executed under certain predefined conditions, if it is believed that there will be sufficient warning to implement the plan. events that trigger the Contingency_Response such as missing intermediate milestones or gaining higher priority with a supplier, should be defined and tracked. Risk_Responses identified using this Plan_Risk_Responses_Tools_And_Techniques are often called Contingency_Plans or Fallback_Plans and include identified triggering events that set the plans in effect.\\nPlan_Risk_Responses_Expert_Judgment is Inputs from knowledgeable parties pertaining to the actions to be taken on a specific and defined risk. expertise may be provided by any group or person with specialized education, knowledge, skill, experience, or training in establishing Risk_Responses.\\n. \\n .

Plan_Risk_Responses_Project_Documents_Updates include Risk_Owners and assigned responsibilities. Plan_Risk_Responses_Project_Documents_Updates include Agreed_Upon_Response_Strategies. Plan_Risk_Responses_Project_Documents_Updates include specific actions to implement the chosen Response_Strategy.

Plan_Risk_Responses_Project_Documents_Updates include secondary risks that arise as a direct outcome of implementing a Risk_Response; an. Plan_Risk_Responses_Project_Documents_Updates include Contingency_Reserves that are calculated based on the Quantitative_Risk_Analysis of the project and the Organization_Risk_Thresholds. \\n. Plan_Risk_Responses_Project_Documents_Updates include Assumptions_Log_Updates. Plan_Risk_Responses_Project_Documents_Updates include Technical_Documentation_Updates. Plan_Risk_Responses_Project_Documents_Updates include Change_Requests. assumptions log updates as new information is available through the application of Risk_Responses, assumptions could change the assumptions log needs to be revisited to accommodate this new information.. technical documentation updates as new information is available through the application of Risk_Responses, technical approaches and physical deliverables may change any supporting documentation needs to be revisited to accommodate this new information.. Change_Requests planning for possible Risk_Responses can often result in recommendations for changes to the resources, activities, Cost_Estimates, and other items identified during other Planning_Processes when such recommendations are identified, Change_Requests are generated and processed through the perform integrated Change_Control_Process.\\nthe Control_Risks_Project_Management_Plan, which includes the Risk_Management_Plan, provides guidance for Risk_Monitoring and controlling.\\nthe Control_Risks_Risk_Register has key Control_Risks_Inputs that include Identified_Risks and Risk_Owners, Agreed_Upon Risk_Responses, Control_Actions for assessing the effectiveness of Response_Plans, Risk_Responses, specific Implementation_Actions, symptoms and Warning_Signs of risk, residual and secondary risks, a Watch_List of Low_Priority_Risks, and the time and cost Contingency_Reserves. the Watch_List is within the Control_Risks_Risk_Register and provides a list of Low_Priority_Risks.\\nWork_Performance_Data related to Performance_results.. Work_Performance_Data include deliverable status. Work_Performance_Data include Schedule_Progress, An. Work_Performance_Data include Costs incurred. \\nWork_Performance_Reports take information from Performance_Measurements and analyze it to provide Project_Work_Performance_Information including Variance_Analysis, earned Value_Data, and Forecasting_Data. these Data_Points could be impactful in controlling performance related risks.\\nControl_Risks often results in identification of new risks, reassessment of current risks, and the closing of risks that are outdated. Project_Risk_Reassessments should be regularly scheduled. the amount and detail of repetition that are appropriate depends on how the project progresses relative to its objectives.\\nRisk_Audits examine and document the effectiveness of Risk_Responses in dealing with Identified_Risks and their Root_Causes, as well as the effectiveness of the Risk_Management_Process. the Project_Manager is responsible for ensuring that Risk_Audits are performed at an appropriate frequency, as defined in the Project_Risk_Management_Plan. Risk_Audits may be included during routine Project_Review_Meetings, or the team may choose to hold separate Risk_Audit_Meetings. the format for the audit and its objectives should be clearly defined before the audit is conducted.\\nmany Control_Processes employ Variance_Analysis to compare the planned results to the Actual_Results. for the purposes of controlling risks, trends in the Project_Execution should be reviewed using Performance_Information. earned Value_Analysis and other methods of Project_Variance_And_Trend_Analysis may be used for monitoring overall Project_Performance. outcomes from these analyses may forecast Potential_Deviation of the project at completion from cost and Schedule_Targets. deviation from the Baseline_Plan may indicate the Potential_Impact of threats or opportunities.\\nTechnical_Performance_Measurement compares technical accomplishments during Project_Execution to the schedule of technical achievement. it requires the definition of objective, quantifiable measures of technical performance, which can be used to compare Actual_Results against targets. such technical Performance_Measures may include weight, Transaction_Times, number of delivered defects, Storage_Capacity, etc. deviation such as demonstrating more or less functionality than planned at a milestone, can help to forecast the degree of success in achieving the Project_Scope.\\nthroughout execution of the project, some risks may occur with positive or negative impacts on budget or Schedule_Contingency_Reserves. Reserve_Analysis compares the amount of the Contingency_Reserves remaining to the amount of risk remaining at any time in the project in order to determine if the remaining reserve is adequate.\\nProject_Risk_Management should be an Agenda_Item at periodic Status_Control_Risks_Meetings. the amount of time required for that item will vary, depending upon the risks that have been identified, their priority, and difficulty of response. the more often Risk_Management is practiced, the easier it becomes. frequent discussions about risk make it more likely that people will identify risks and opportunities.\\nWork_Performance_Information, as a Control_Risks_Output, provides a mechanism to communicate and support Project_Decision_Making.\\nimplementing Contingency_Plans or workarounds sometimes results in a Change_Request. Change_Requests are prepared and submitted to the perform integrated Change_Control_Process( section 4.5).\\n. Change_Requests include Recommended_Corrective_Actions. Change_Requests include Recommended_Preventive_Actions. recommended corrective actions these are activities that realign the performance of the Project_Work with the Project_Management_Plan they include Contingency_Plans and workarounds the latter are responses that were not initially planned, but are required to deal with emerging risks that were previously unidentified or accepted passively. recommended Preventive_Actions these are activities that ensure that future performance of the Project_Work is aligned with the Project_Management_Plan.\\nif the approved Change_Requests have an effect on the Risk_Management_Processes, the corresponding Component_Documents of the Project_Management_Plan are revised and reissued to reflect the approved changes. the elements of the Project_Management_Plan that may be updated are the same as those in the Plan_Risk_Responses_Process.\\nProject_Documents that may be updated as a result of the Control_Risk_Process include the Risk_Register. Risk_Register updates may Include:•_Outcomes of Risk_Reassessments, Risk_Audits, and periodic Risk_Reviews. these outcomes may include identification of new risks, updates to probability, impact, priority, Response_Plans, ownership, and other elements of the Risk_Register. outcomes can also include Closing_Risks that are no longer applicable and releasing their associated reserves.\\n• Actual_Outcomes of the Project_Risks and of the Risk_Responses. this information can help Project_Managers to plan for risk throughout their organizations, as well as on future projects .the Risk_Management_Processes produce information that may be used for future projects, and should be captured in the Organizational_Process_Assets.. Organizational_Process_Assets_Updates include templates for the Risk_Management_Plan include the probability and Impact_Matrix and Risk_Register. Organizational_Process_Assets_Updates include Risk_Breakdown_Structure, An. Organizational_Process_Assets_Updates include Lessons learned from the Project_Risk_Management_Activities. \\n these documents should be updated as needed and at Project_Closure. final versions of the Risk_Register and the Risk_Management_Plan_Templates, checklists, and Risk_Breakdown_Structure are included.\\n'"
